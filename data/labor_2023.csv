SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS","Sexual harassment is a scourge in our society, prevalent across indus- tries and professions. As recent revelations drive home, the culture that enables this harassment is often cultivated and safeguarded by employers. Though New York State has a strong policy against sexual harassment and discrimination, it sends mixed messages to employers when it provides tax credits to companies that harbor a culture of sexual harassment. New York State taxpayers should not subsidize businesses that shield sexual harassment and misconduct. Though tax credits are used to incen- tivize economic development, economic development should not come at the expense of employee safety. This legislation requires that every corporation develop and implement a written workplace sexual harassment, sexual assault and discrimination policy. Corporations must also maintain detailed records of all claims filed and keep these records for a period of five years. Under this legislation, any corporation subject to taxation shall file an annual report with the New York State Division of Human Rights, which will include the corporate policy on handling of such claims, and the outcome of each claim filed. Following a review from the Division of Human Rights, corporations will receive a certificate if they are deemed eligible to receive tax credits. Any company deemed noncompliant follow- ing this review, will be ineligible for any tax credit provided by the state of New York. The Division of Human Rights will establish the stan- dard by which corporations shall be eligible for state tax credits based on their record. These steps will increase transparency, promote the values of equality and justice and ensure that taxpayers are not subsi- dizing egregious, illegal behavior.",2021-22: A.140 - Referred to Labor 2019-20: A.24 - Referred to Labor 2017-18: A.9797 - Referred to Labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,Undetermined.,"This bill shall take effect on January 1, 2024.",https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A00095&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y
A00108,A108,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to prohibiting employers from certain monitoring activities of employees working at home",Rosenthal L,,This legislation will protect employee privacy by prohibiting employers from installing tracking programs on the personal devices of employees working from home. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, employees around the state began working from home and it is expected that many will continue to do so going forward. Once employees began working from home en masse, many companies implemented systems and programs to monitor their employee's work and productivity. An April 2020 news article in The Washington Post revealed that many employers requested or required employees working from home to download apps or programs to their personal computers and other devices to track their activity throughout the day. These programs allow employ- ers to track keyboard strokes, mouse movements, website browsing histo- ries, view UPS location, take screen captures and even access the webcams installed on devices to routinely take photos to ensure the employee is actively working. Employees working inside their own homes should not be under constant surveillance by their employer. The increased popularity of these programs also creates the opportunity for employers to continue tracking employees once the pandemic subsides and employees return to their work- place. With the increase in the number of employees working from home, these programs set a dangerous precedent for the privacy of workers going forward. As our concept of a modern workplaces changes over time and as a result of technological advances, these tracking programs further blur the line between personal and professional time. This legislation will prohibit any employer in the state of New York from requiring or requesting that an employee download or install any type of tracking program to their personal device. It also strictly limits the type of information that can be collected on a company-owned device.",2021-22: A.6090 - Referred to Labor 2019-20: A.10657 - Referred to Labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This act shall take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A00108&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

A00310,A310,An act directing the commissioner of labor to conduct a labor market study and establishing a temporary labor task force for home care and hospice services and occupations in New York State; and providing for the repeal of certain provisions upon the expiration thereof,Bronson,,"To authorize the state commissioner of labor, with the assistance of collaborating state agencies, to conduct a competitive labor market study to assess and make recommendations for home care and hospice capa- bility to compete in the labor market for recruitment and retention of direct care staff to meet patient and health system needs, and to estab- lish a taskforce to promote entrance, practice, career development and retention in home health and hospice occupations, including home health aide, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, social work and others that the commissioner designates. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS","Both New York State and the United States Department of Labor analyses show home care occupations to be among the top projected occupational needs for the foreseeable future. The needs are driven and compounded by: major demographic changes (in particular the aging of the popu- lation); changes in state of the art medical practice enabling individ- uals to live longer, and to survive and live adapting to major trauma and chronic illness; major changes in hospital and institutional care use prompted by state and federal health care reforms; and other. Recruitment and retention of individuals for health occupations in home care and hospice sufficient to meet demand is a major challenge on its own, but is made more complex by home care and hospice's less compet- itive positions in the labor market and in the lesser awareness and interest of individuals to enter and work in the home care and hospice fields. Home care and hospice& ability to compete to-recruit and retain staff is at a huge disadvantage as these providers are also most often not reimbursed at competitive levels with other major employers in the market for the same health labor force, and when work in the home care and hospice fields is inherently demanding in unique and extremely chal- lenging ways. The lack of individuals entering and staying in home care and hospice occupations, in comparison to the current and future need, is of crisis proportions around NYS in terms Of patient access and over- all health system function.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:,"The internet has created a world where anyone with a smartphone can become a producer of content and parents and other caretakers can easily upload videos of children, creating viral moments. Child influencers, or children who star in online content that generates earnings for the account holder, lack the protections granted to chil- dren working in the film and television industry. With more parents and children creating social media content each day, there is an increased need for regulations to protect children against exploitation. In 2016, Myka and James Stauffer rose to internet fame as they chroni- cled their family's journey to adopt a special needs child named Huxley from China. Huxley's participation in the content created by the Stauf- fers yielded lucrative results, including product sponsorships, and garnered millions of loyal viewers. Unfortunately, the couple shockingly revealed their decision to ""rehome"" Huxley nearly 2 1/2 years after his adoption. It is it unclear whether the child reaped any financial bene- fit from the franchise he had no choice in creating. Our labor laws have not kept pace with the digital age, and as a result, ""kid influencers"" are falling through the cracks. This bill will ensure that children that participate in creating online content receive their share of earnings that the content may generate. Like children working in the film and television industry, this legislation would require the creation of a trust account for minors when their appearances make up a significant portion of the content shared on such account and generates earnings.

A00346,A346,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to the prevention of employ- ees being exposed to excessive heat",Cruz,,Establishes standards and training requirements to help prevent and address excessive heat exposure for delivery workers. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"Heat exposure poses a serious threat to millions of workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 1992 through 2016, heat stress has killed 783 workers and caused serious injuries to 69,374 workers. With climate change, this warming trend will only accelerate, which means more and more workers will become vulnerable to heat-related illnesses or death. Delivery workers are at a particularly high risk of heat-related illness since they are required to work long hours in delivery trucks without air conditioning. It has been reported that some employees even try to save all of their vacation hours for the hottest days of the year since they fear to work in extreme heat without proper protection. To safeguard our delivery workers from heat-related illnesses, the legislature must take the necessary steps to ensure employers are providing their workers with a safe work environment. It is discouraging that a worker can still be forced to work long hours on the hottest days of the year yet have no proper access to water, cooling stations, or paid breaks. Without set standards, employers will fail to be held accountable and workers will continue to suffer heat strokes. Heat-related illnesses are preventable, yet so many workers remain vulnerable. Therefore, this legislation requires the Department of Labor, with the Department of Health, to set maximum heat exposure stan- dards for all delivery companies, including companies like FedEx and UPS. Employers would also be required to develop prevention plans to combat heat-related illnesses, which would include paid breaks in cool down areas, access to water, emergency response plans, limitations on how long an employee can be exposed to heat, and more. Employees, along with supervisors, would receive training on how to recognize and respond to heat-related illnesses. Retaliation against an employee who exercises their rights under this new law would be prohibited too. By creating these new standards, New York will ensure workers who are exposed to excessive heat will be provided with safe work conditions.","2019: S6719, Kaminsky.

Moreover, the present crises under- score that New York's private sector workers, 'especially those who provide essential services in health care, transportation, food services, agriculture, and retail, among other industries, are vitally important to the functioning of our society. Each day during the ongo- ing pandemic and economic fluctuations, New York's essential workers have put their lives on the line to deliver important life-sustaining services to their fellow New Yorkers and Americans across the country. Perhaps the most painful financial consequence of the pandemic has been the catastrophic loss of jobs. Layoffs and business closures are emotionally taxing and financially painful events for individuals and their families, and can also have significant impacts on the State, local communities, and other businesses that feel the economic ripple effects. These consequences are made even more dire when layoffs are announced suddenly, as occurred when the State imposed COVID-19 lockdown measures, leaving affected parties without sufficient time to react and adjust. The State assumes some of the burden in many cases, including by providing unemployment assistance and other social services support, but in some circumstances, the employer should assume financial responsibil- ity for its layoffs. Recognizing the challenges posed by surprise job losses, the New York State Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires employers with 50 or more employees who plan a mass layoff, facility shutdown, or relocation to provide 90 calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees, appropriate labor representatives, the New York Department of Labor, and certain other relevant government entities prior to such employment loss. This buffer time period allows workers to find alternate employment and take other steps to protect themselves from the imminent financial challenges associated with being laid off. At a time when workers continue to face difficult times from the effects of the pandemic and a number of economic challenges, this financial runway has never been more important. To hold employers to account when they do not comply with the WARN Act, the statute imposes penalties and liability for back pay. Notwithstanding worker protections in the current statute, many mass layoffs nonetheleSs result in violations for which employees are riot properly compensated. For instance, current law allows parties with financial interests in a business to use corporate shields or other sophisticated legal tactics to avoid some of the obligations of the WARN Act that fall on the employer, even if those financial actors effec- tively exercise control over the business. Such brazen activity has been well-documented over the years in the private equity industry, but a telling, recent, pre-pandemic example is the case of the Doral Arrowwood Resort, located in the Village of Rye Brook. The hotel informed its approximately 275 employees on Christmas Eve of 2019 that it would be shutting down on January 12, 2020, just 19 days later. These employees, many of whom worked there for decades, were faced with the prospect of being unemployed and without income in short order, putting most of them at significant personal financial risk. Although they were due back pay under the WARN Act, the complicated nature of the legal proceedings regarding the ownership of the hotel, and the loopholes and exceptions present in the current statute, allowed numerous opportunities for the lenders and other financial investors to challenge workers' WARN Act protections. While the intricate ownership and lending structure was being sorted out in a foreclosure proceeding, the employees were forced to the sidelines, uncertain if they would receive anything. In a rare but welcome victory, the workers ultimately won and received their back pay, but that result was held up for nearly two years by legal wrangling arising out of th e shortcomings of the current WARN Act statute, and many of them suffered further financial distress due to the compounding effects of the pandemic while waiting for that compensation. Frustrations with current law such as these are made worse by COVID-19 and the associated economic difficulties, which have created new oppor- tunities for employers to take advantage of a variety of loopholes in the law to engage in malfeasance and assert spurious justifications to evade compliance with the WARN Act. For example, these statutory escape hatches exempt employers from the notice requirements by asserting that a mass layoff was ""not reasonably foreseeable."" While this was undoubt- edly the case for many businesses when the disaster emergency was first declared, the pandemic and depressed economy also acted as cover for employers to layoff workers without sufficient notice and escape their financial obligations to them. This bill, similar to reforms signed into law in New Jersey in 2020, constitutes comprehensive reform to protect private sector workers in mass layoff situations, and ensures augmented stability and accountabil- ity as we rebuild our economy. As a centerpiece, this legislation would require that severance be paid to every laid off worker when there is a qualifying employment loss under the WARN Act. Severance payments would be equal to one week of pay for each year of service, a recognition of the value of worker loyalty. Additional progressive, worker-centric changes include broadening the definition of liable employers, closing easily-exploited loopholes, and empowering the State to take a more active enforcement role. These changes position this legislation as a powerful backstop to ensure more certain and equitable remedies for workers' lost employment and to hold culpable corporate actors responsi- ble in mass layoff situations. These policy changes would also have the ancillary benefit of alleviating some of the financial burden placed on the State when large numbers of workers are suddenly laid off, a welcome respite for an unemployment assistance program that has been stretched to the breaking point. The economic reverberations of the COVID-l9 pandemic and the resulting unprecedented unemployment only underscore the fragility of many work- ers' financial situations. The shortcomings in current law leave room for the State to provide more stability for workers in a moment when they most need assurances of economic security, and this bill is part of the paradigm shift which is necessary to better protect our workers in the on-going uncertainty regarding COVID-19 and its attendant conse- quences.

Ardila, Paulin, Lunsford, Darling, Davila",Creates a Minimum Standards Council for the Nail Salon Industry in New York State. :,"The nail salon industry in New York State for too long has had standards set by low road employers. In New York State, employers who want to do the right thing by following the law-and treating their workers with dignity and respect- are put at a competitive disadvantage by employers breaking the law and providing low standards. Take the minimum wage as an example. In 2020 the Department of Labor and Governor's office decided to end the tipped minimum wage for nail salon workers. However, the New York Nail Salon Workers Association in their ""One Fair Wage Denied: Chasing Compliance in NY's Nail Salon Industry "" reported that in April 2021 76% of workers surveyed were being paid less than the minimum wage throughout the state. Research shows that low prices and wage theft are correlated. It is no surprise that New York prices have remained stagnant for years- NYC and LI price being $13.71. While wages are an egregious example of low wage employers creating lower standards for workers, it is not the only example. Around health & safety, scheduling practices, and benefits for workers we see how the state allowing for low standards makes it impossible for employers who want to treat their employees with dignity to do so. This groundbreaking bill proposes the creation of a minimum standards council for the Nail Salon Industry in pursuit of a more sustainable business model for employers and better standards for workers. The coun- cil is sat on by six voting employers, six voting employees, three non- voting representatives of both the employers and employees, and three public representatives. The council would negotiate minimum standards around health & safety, working conditions, scheduling, wages, etc. The council would make recommendations to be adopted by the labor commis- sioner within a two year period. At the same time, a minimum pricing committee would be established to help recommend pricing model standards to eliminate wage theft in the industry and make it harder for low road employers to break minimum wage laws and hurt employers who are follow- ing the law.

This legislation would make it less burdensome for workers to receive the full compensation for their injury by assuming that a worker on SSDI has permanent total disability. Those on SSDI are already considered totally disabled at the federal level, and therefore, are unable to perform even sedentary work. Those that cannot work should be receiving the highest benefits available at 66.6% of their average weekly wages.

Since 2008, federal law has required the use of specified safe work practices and training for RRP work in pre-1978 residential dwellings performed by hired contractors. While the federal RRP rules permit states to assume enforcement of this program, New York (unlike many states) has not done so -- even though New York State has the highest number of older resi- dential dwellings with lead-based paint in the nation, and as well the highest number of childhood lead poisoning cases in the nation. This has left enforcement to the federal EPA, which has consistently failed to bring adequate resources to ensure compliance, as EPA's Inspector Gener- al reported in 2019. For example, EPA has just 3.5 inspectors to cover a vast region consisting of New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The proposed bill would enable NY to assume administration of the RRP rules, allowing New York to conduct training, certification, and enforcement of the RRP. The proposal would also require the use of empirically based dust wipe clearance tests (rather than the problematic ""cleaning verification"" used in the federal regulations) to assure prop- er cleaning of hazardous lead dust once work is completed. The fees for accreditation of persons to do this work would be used to fund the program. A detailed report from the Community Foundation of Buffalo estimated that this bill would protect some 140,000 children under age 6 each year from lead hazard exposure in some 483,000 homes undergoing RRP work annually.

First, they must pay back any improperly received benefits, and in addition, are subject to a monetary penalty equal to one-hundred dollars or fifteen percent of the overpayment, whichever is higher. The U.S. Department of Labor mandates this penalty. The second penalty is a ""forfeit day"" penalty, which is a day or days in the future in which the claimant cannot receive unemployment insurance benefits. This double penalty structure is burdensome on claimants, especially considering that sometimes claimants found to have willfully made a false statement or misrepresentation fit into more of a grey area. For example, one claimant who is not a native English speaker, selected ""lack of work"" instead of ""firing"" for the reason for his separation although he was fully honest with the investigator, due to his initial selection he was determined to have made a willful misrepresentation. The Executive proposed eliminating forfeit day penalties in the in Part P of ELFA of the Executive proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2019-2020. In contrast, there is no penalty for employers who willfully make false statements or misrepresentations in order to avoid the payment of bene- fits. A false statement made by an employer can delay or even prevent an unemployment insurance claimant from receiving benefits that are right- fully owed. For example, one claimant was initially denied benefits because she had missed the first day of a hearing, and on that day her employer submitted papers showing repeated warnings of her firing. The claimant's benefits were then cut off. When the claimant returned with representation, the claimant submitted originals showing that the employer-submitted documents were altered and the original decision was reversed. A penalty of fifteen percent of the benefits determined are owed to the claimant would deter this kind of fraudulent conduct that affects especially vulnerable out of work individuals.",": 2019-2020: 54992 (Ramos)- Referred to Labor, Advanced to Rules 2021-2022: A6680 (Burgos) - Referred to Labor S2136 (Ramos) - Referred to Labor",There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None,This act shall take effect sixty days after it is to become a law.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A00542&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

When an employee is injured on the job, he or she relies on workers' compensation insurance benefits to cover medical expenses related to their injury. Most insurance carriers assign a claims representative to specific claimants and such representative is the claimant's point of contact at the insurance company to help with facilitating coverage. It is not uncommon for insurance carriers to reassign a claims represen- tative when necessary. This can lead to a delay in resolution of claims and obtaining coverage for needed medical services when the claimant is unaware that their representative has changed. This situation can be especially problematic for those who are left out of work long term or even permanently and experience regular turnover of their claims repre- sentatives. Individuals receiving workers' compensation should be given notice when they are assigned to a new claims representative to ensure prompt resolution of their claims.","2021 and 2022: A.3933 referred to labor. 2019 and 2020: A.358 referred to labor. 2018: A.11372, referred to labor.",There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have become a law.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A00571&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

A00769,A769,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to prohibiting discrimination based upon wage and benefit history",Weprin,,To combat wage inequity by prohibiting employers from asking about applicants' salaries before offering them a job. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"Wage discrimination occurs when employees performing comparable work do not receive similar remuneration for their work. Despite like efforts to combat wage discrimination (Title VII, the ADA and ADEA, state antidiscrimination laws, and the Equal Pay Act), research shows that women currently earn 79 cents for each dollar earned by their male counterparts, with women of color and women with children earning an even lower wage per dollar earned. Wage discrimination also affects people in other protected classes, such as people with disabili- ties and minority groups. Although the vast majority of employers in New York do not seek to intentionally discriminate based on wage, and are proponents of equal pay; the practice continues to endure due to the institutionalized nature of wage discrimination. Currently, employers are able to determine an applicant's wage based on a salary history or record of previous wages. If an applicant was previ- ously paid at a lower wage than what the employer was prepared to offer, an employer could get away with offering a lower wage than originally anticipated. This is an unfair practice that penalizes workers for their previous socioeconomic status and discriminates against historically disadvantaged groups. Under the proposed law, employers would be required to state a compen- sation figure upfront based on an applicant's worth to the company. Employers are also prohibited from asking for an applicant's salary history prior to a job offer. These changes would have the effect of a fairer workplace, as wages would be based on the work performed, rather than on an employee's socioeconomic status. Ending wage discrimination would have several other benefits for our society from improving our local economy to lowering levels of poverty. Each cent removed from an employee through wage discrimination is a cent removed from our local economy, and a cent removed from a working fami- ly's budget. According to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, an organization that supported similar legislation in Massachusetts;.""Fifty percent of the Greater Boston workforce is made up of women, yet studies show that even in 2016, women are earning significantly less on average than their male counterpart& And wage inequality not only affects businesses, it also has a negative impact on families and the overall Massachusetts economy.""

A00852,A852,"An act to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to authoriz- ing care and treatment of injured employees by licensed clinical social workers",Pretlow,Epstein,The bill authorizes the care and treatment of injured employees by licensed clinical social workers under the workers' compensation program. The expansion of qualified mental health providers available to deliver permitted psychotherapeutic treatment will afford injured work- ers greater access to care and more provider options across New York State.,"Currently, the only providers under the workers' compensation Law that may deliver mental health services to injured workers are physicians and licensed psychologists. Lack of access to qualified mental health care providers can prolong an injured workers' return to work. The state education department website lists the total number of regis- tered licensed psychologists, licensed clinical social workers and licensed master social workers. In each county listed, the total number of licensed social workers outnumbers psychologists at least eight to one. An extreme example is Wyoming County. Wyoming County is 596 square miles and largely rural with scattered small towns. It has a population of 43,424, of which there is only one licensed psychologist. By allowing clinical social workers to provide services which clearly lie within their scope of practice, the availability of service providers in Wyom- ing County could potentially increase by up to 400%, greatly increasing the pool of culturally competent mental health providers as well as treatment options for injured workers. It may also address geographic issues such as an injured worker who may not be inclined to travel 100 miles to receive services, but by increasing options, he or she may only have to travel 10 minutes, increasing accessibility, and increasing the probability that those who needs service will seek and utilize them. On December 22, 2005, Judge Budd Goodman presiding in the New York Coun- ty Supreme Court of the State of New York issued a decision that clari- fied that licensed clinical social workers, and licensed psychologists share the equivalent scopes of practice and professional functions with respect the kinds of care that is provided under the Workers' Compen- sation system. New York State has a long history of providing health care consumers with the freedom of choosing from a number of qualified health care service providers. Currently, licensed clinical social workers are eligible to receive reimbursement for the mental health services they provide to persons covered by (1) a variety of federal government health insurance plans, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBF), which covers 10 million federal employees, retirees and their dependents, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) which is now referred to as Tricare and serves approximately 5.5 million beneficiaries, and Medicare, which has author- ized clinical social workers to provide mental health services since 1990 and (2) essentially all managed behavioral health plans regionally and nationally as well as all group insurance plans in New York State. As such, licensed clinical social workers are currently eligible provid- ers of mental health services to federal and state employees, and the dependents of military personnel stationed in New York, as well as to the many citizens of our state whose medical expenses are covered by managed behavioral and group health insurance plans. This bill would grant the same access to mental health service providers for job-related injuries under the Workers' Compensation Law that is now available for an insured individual's non job-related injuries. Many rural and inner city areas throughout New York are continuously struggl- ing with a lack of accessible and qualified providers of mental health services. This bill assists the injured workers in the shortage areas throughout the state by affording them the more accessible healthcare option of a licensed clinical social worker. Furthermore, this bill would not result in increased costs. The cost of providing services to persons covered under New York's workers' compen- sation system is a function of the number of patients who require such care, not the number of covered professionals who may not provide it. Lastly, licensed clinical social workers have unique skills in providing psychotherapeutic treatment within the context of the patient's environ- ment as well as utilizing community, family and other social resources as an adjunct to treatment. It is this methodology which may reduce workers' compensation costs by enhancing the process of rehabilitating persons who suffer from work-related illnesses and injuries, and return- ing them more quickly to gainful employment.",2021-2022 A1589 referred to Labor 2019-20A3444 referred to labor 01/03/18A3677 referred to labor 05/12/15A7457 referred to labor 01/06/16A7457 referred to labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,"This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after it shall have become a law.

A00866,A866,"An act to amend the executive law, in relation to the independent livery driver benefit fund",Gibbs,"Colton, Taylor, Novakhov, Cunningham","To require any dispatch base or entity, regardless of type, that dispatches to a New York City Livery vehicle affiliated with a New York City livery base, to be a member of the New York Independent Livery Driver Benefit Fund (the ""Livery Fund""). This ensures that when livery drivers are involved in accidents, they are eligible for workers compen- sation benefits provided by the Livery Fund.","Historically, livery drivers were the black sheep of the for-hire vehi- cle industry as they were unable to access workers compensation benefits if they were injured while working. This inability to obtain workers compensation insurance coverage arose from ineligibility to become members of the Black Car Fund and other insurance companies denying coverage for such claims. The situation became so dire that in 2008 legislation was specifically enacted to create the Livery Fund (See Article 6G of the Executive Law). Since January 1,2010, the date the Livery Fund came into existence, over 11 years has past and time has proven the Livery Fund to be a roaring success because it closed the gap in workers' compensation coverage for livery drivers and clarified the responsibility of all bases to procure a specific type of workers' compensation insurance when they send dispatches to the operators of Livery vehicles. Since such time, and for the first time in the history, all for-hire vehicle drivers are entitled to workers compensation cover- age in the event of a work-related accident. In practice today, high volume ride sharing services, such as Uber, send dispatches to livery drivers through its livery bases which are member s of the ""Livery Fund"". Similarly, Uber dispatches to black car drivers through its' Black Car Bases which are a member of the Black Car Fund. On May 4, 2021, the local taxi & limousine regulatory agency proposed a rule clas- sifying high-volume services, such as Uber and Lyft, as a separate class (base), termed HighVolume-Service Base (""HVS""). However, while the proposed rule requires the HVS to be a member of the Black Car Fund, it does not require a HVS that sends dispatches to a livery driver to be a member of the Livery Fund. The proposed rule that eliminates the need for a HVS to be a member of the Livery Fund would result in livery driv- ers having no workers' compensation coverage in the event the livery driver is involved in an accident while on a dispatch sent by a HVS and/or the HVS may simply decide to stop dispatching trips to livery drivers due to the lack of workers' compensation coverage. No HVS will remain a member of the Livery Fund if it is forced to only be a member of the Black Car Fund. Also, no livery driver will continue to operate a livery vehicle if trips dispatched by a HVS requires the livery driver to risk sustaining a work-related injury without having workers' compen- sation coverage. The local regulatory agency can easily prevent this gap in insurance and the demise of the livery sector by simply amending its proposed rule to also require a HVS that sends dispatches to livery drivers operating a livery vehicle to be a member of the Livery Fund. Furthermore, mandating HVS to become members of the Livery Fund will not place any added burden or added cost on the HVS. The HVS will maintain workers compensation coverage for livery drivers under the Livery Fund, as the State law mandates. Most importantly, amendment of the proposed rule as , stated herein will in no way change the regulatory scheme which the local regulatory agency seeks to enact via its proposed regu- lations. This legislation is intended to prevent situations whereby local regulatory agencies allow private companies to dispatch to a livery without first securing the protection of workers compensation coverage that the Livery Fund provides under the state law, or forcing the livery driver/livery sector to not be able to receive trips from a HVS and thus, be forced to go out of business, all while black cars are able to receive dispatches from HVS.","A8084 2021/2022, A9836 2021/2022",There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This act shall take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A00866&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"The right to strike is a fundamental right belonging to all workers, along with the rights to organize and choose representatives for the purposes of bargaining, but the right to strike is not protected by our constitution. Strikes are responsible for many of the benefits employees in all sectors enjoy today, including the 40-hour work-week, weekends, and the eight-hour work-day. The history of strikes and industrial actions in New York and the United States is the history of the advance- ment of our society's standard of living. To deny any worker the right to withhold his or her labor in protest is to deny employees use of the tool by which our society has become more just and humane. Denial of this fundamental right also leaves many employees powerless to challenge unfair or unsafe working conditions. Section 17 of article 1 of the state constitution begins with the state- ment, ""Labor of human beings is not a commodity."" If this is true then the right of an employee to withhold his or her labor must be inaliena- ble. Yet our current laws deny both farmworkers and public sector work- ers the right to withhold their labor. Notably, farmworkers are over- whelmingly Latino, and the public sector has historically been an important employer of women and people of color. For these reasons, codifying the right to strike is also an important and essential oppor- tunity to empower working-class women and people of color in New York. No employee should be denied this fundamental right.",A9115 (2022) - died in committee.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This bill is effective immediately after concurrent passage in the Assembly and Senate in two consecutive legislative sessions and subse- quent ratification by voters through a ballot referendum at the next general election.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A00906&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

These barriers are complicated further by the limited number of medical professionals who are licensed as eligible providers under the workers compensation system.

A01076,A1076,"An act to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to workplace safety and loss prevention programs",Zebrowski,"Stirpe, Hunter, Thiele",The purpose of this bill is to update the annual payroll amount that triggers the requirement for employers to undergo a workplace safety and loss prevention consultation and written evaluation.,"The Workplace Safety & Loss Prevention Program was created in 1997 by statute to reduce workplace injuries. The program is required for all employers whose most recent annual payroll is in excess of $800,000 and whose most recent experience rating exceeds the level of 1.2. Employers who meet these criteria are required to undergo a workplace safety and loss prevention consultation and evaluation. Employers required to undergo a consultation and evaluation must pay a fee for the required consultation, which must be performed by a certified consultant. These fees can be substantial. Any additional costs incurred during the course of the consultation, such as sampling, laboratory fees and laboratory reports, must be paid by the employer in addition to the consultation fee. If remedial action is recommended by the consultant, it must be implemented by the employer within six months. Employers can spend several thousands of dollars to comply with the requirements of the statute. Over the last 21 years, payrolls have increased substantially. The law, which was originally intended to apply to larger employers, is now capturing smaller ones because the payroll threshold has not been adjusted. A recent annual report of the Workers Compensation Insurance Rating Board, which administers the program, indicates a 46% increase in the number of employers' who were required to undergo a safety and loss prevention consultation and evaluation in 2014 compared to 2013. The failure to update the payroll threshold to reflect current labor costs is resulting in increased administrative and financial burdens on New York's small businesses. Therefore, the $800,000 payroll threshold needs to be adjusted to reflect today's payroll costs. Based upon the increase in wages and salaries of private industry workers as reported by in the Employment Cost Index published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a payroll threshold of $800,000 in 1997 would equate today to approximately $1.2 million.","A.1130 of 2021-22, A.3547 of 2019-20, A.1458-A of 2017-18, A.9807 of 2015-16.",There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeeding the date on which is shall have become a law.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A01076&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

The NRC openly admits that it can only oversee a small portion of the industry's safety issues and relies heavily on nuclear plant employees to identify poten- tial safety problems to management and, if necessary, to the NRC. This bill acknowledges that a key element to the safe operation of nuclear power plants is a work environment that encourages employees to come forward with any concerns they may have regarding reactor operational safety. Protection of safety-conscious workers is of paramount concern, especially in light of electric utility deregulation, the infusion of market competition into the energy marketplace, and changes with the NRC's oversight program. One of NY's more notable plants, Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant, has for years operated with continual safety violations. The plant has had upwards of 40 safety events, operational events and shutdowns since 2012 alone. Employees working at nuclear power plants should not feel pres- sured or intimidated by their supervisors in airing safety concerns that arise, like those that have occurred at Indian Point. Nuclear power plant workplace culture seems to emphasize silence over safety. Sadly, we have witnessed the harassment of employees at NY nuclear power plants much too often. Given the troubles at the Indian Point reactors, there has never been a greater need for such a program. The controversy that has swarmed about the Indian Point reactors has shed light on the suppression of safety-conscious employees and worker health and safety issues. As stated in a report filed by a safety-conscious employee at Con Edison's Indian Point 2 (IP-2) plant, there is a ""chilling effect"" which does not encourage workers to report. problems. Governor Cuomo plans to close the Indian Point Energy Center by April 2021. The state has forged an agreement with Entergy to end all operations at the facil- ity from April 2020-April 2021. However, there are still the Ginna Nuclear Generating Station, the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant and the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Stations that for the fore- seeable future will maintain operations. New York State needs to better protect workers at nuclear power plants who raise safety concerns. According to Stephen Kohn, one of the nation's foremost experts on whistleblower law, New York State has one of the weakest provisions in the nation with respect to providing adequate protection, to whistleblowers. The inadequacies of New York's ""Whistleblower Statute,"" which was passed in 1964, have led commentators to note that whistleblower protection in New York is all but non-exis- tent. 21St century law should provide for public and employee _ health and safety. It is crucial to have a nuclear whistleblower access and assistance program established for as long as NY maintains nuclear power plant operations.","2022: A444 (Rozic) - Labor 2021: A444 (Rozic) - Labor 2020: A7482 (Rozic) - Labor 2019: A7482 (Rozic) - Labor 2018: S55604 No Same As - died in Energy and Telecom. 2017: S55604 No Same As - died in Energy and Telecom 2016: S2777A No Same As - died in Energy and Telecom 2015: S2777A No Same As - died in Energy and Telecom 2014:S3267A No Same As - died in Energy and Telecom 2013: S3267A No Same As - died in Energy and Telecom 2012: A 4799A (Galef) - Recommit to Labor 2011: A4799A (Galef) - Recommit to Rules 2010: A5200A (Brodsky) - died in Rules 2009: A5200A (Brodsky) - died in Rules 2008: A1378 (Brodsky) - passed Assembly, died in Energy and Telecom 2007: A1378 (Brodsky) - passed Assembly, died in Energy and Telecom 2006: A7365 (Brodsky) - passed Assembly, died in Energy and Telecom 2005: A7365 (Brodsky) - passed Assembly, died in Energy and Telecom 2004: A2816 (Brodsky) - died in Energy and Telecom 2003: A2816 (Brodsky) - died in Energy and Telecom 2002: A528A (Brodsky) - passed Assembly, died in Energy and Telecom 2001: A528A.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"In today's day and age, most individuals possess an online account of some form. These include social media accounts, bank accounts, and email accounts among others. Generally, when someone asks for access to the login information for, or non-public content of, a personal online acdd44tii an individual is free to say ""no."" However, that is not always the case in employment and educational contexts. Employers may have the power to coerce access to personal online accounts of individuals who are, or seek to become, their employees. Similarly, educational insti- tutions may have coercive power over those who are, or seek to become, their students. When an employer or educational institution asks for the login information for, or non-public content of, an employee's or student's online account, that person may find it difficult to refuse. A growing number of reports in recent years show an increasing trend where employers and educational institutions have demanded and received access to personal online accounts. This legislation implements a proposal of the Uniform Law Commission. As such, it will serve as a guidepost for legislation pertaining to employees and student's online privacy across the nation. Its uniformity will allow other states to enact similar privacy legislation, thereby creating a consistent and uniform set of protections and guidelines across the country, rather than each state passing singular pieces of legislation. The Uniform Law Commission members are not only practicing lawyers but also judges, legislators and legislative staff and law professors, who have been appointed by state governments as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to research, draft and promote enactment of uniform state laws in areas of state law where uniformity is desirable and practical. The state uniform law commissioners come together as the Uniform Law Commission for one purpose, which is to study and review the law of the states to determine which areas of law should be uniform. The commis- sioners promote the principle of uniformity by drafting and proposing specific statutes in areas of the law where uniformity between the states are desirable.

Simon, Zebrowski, Wallace, McDonough","To provide cheerleaders employed by a professional sports team with rights, protections, and benefits.","In April 2014, six former members of the Buffalo Jills Cheerleading Squad (""Jills"") filed a wage theft lawsuit against the Buffalo Bills and two for-profit contractors alleging that they were not paid minimum wage for their work. Since that time the Court has allowed the National Foot- ball League (NFL) to be added as a defendant and denied their motion to dismiss based on the NFL Commissioner's approval of contracts providing that the Jills would not be paid for working Buffalo Bills games. The labor issue includes but is not limited to payment in a timely manner, reimbursement for mandatory expenses, fraudulent misclassifica- tion, penalties for minor infractions with unlawful deductions from earnings, and failure to adhere to the notice and record keeping requirements under the New York State Wage Theft Prevention Act. The lawsuit is one of five that have been filed against National Foot- ball League teams such as the Oakland Raiders and the Tampa Bay Bucca- neers. The Jills have been able to proceed with their lawsuit because the legality of their contract has been brought into question. According to court documents, the contract terms are illegal, void, and unenforce- able. As reports of minimum wage violations continue to make headlines, it is clear that legal protections must be strengthened to ensure that workers are not being stripped of their basic rights under state law. This bill would address an inequity that fosters worker exploitation and hinders any progress the state makes in the fight for equal pay. If enacted, New York-based professional sports teams utilizing the services of cheerleaders would provide them with the specified rights and benefits afforded to its employees under existing employment laws.

A01424,A1424,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to contract provisions waiv- ing certain substantive and procedural rights",Rozic (MS),"Wallace, Stirpe, Lupardo, Simon, Dinowitz",This bill would prevent the enforcement of certain employee contract provisions that conceal certain details or waive procedural rights or remedies.,"New York State has a tradition of enacting strong labor and antidiscrim- ination laws to protect employee rights. Attempts by employers to compel employees to waive those protections as a condition of employment, particularly pertaining to sexual harassment and discrimination protections, are unconscionable and should be explicitly prohibited in New York as a matter of public policy. Recent high-profile reports of sexual misconduct by powerful executives have highlighted the role nondisclosure agreements play in protecting abusive workplace cultures. These agreements are typically reached as part of confidential settlements and include a provision that neither party discusses the details of the case. The secrecy of these agreements perpetuates cultures of sexual harassment and abuse by ensuring that victims stay silent and the public stays uninformed. The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that ""a confidentiality rule prohibiting employees from discussing their sexual harassment complaints among themselves"" constitutes an unfair labor practice in violation of the Wagner Act. However, nothing prevents an employer from using a nondisclosure agreement to bar an employee from seeking legal action if he or she is a victim of workplace harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or nonpayment of wages. This bargaining arrangement gives undue power and control to an employer who can continue to engage in misconduct while an employee is left without legal recourse. Further, the agreement conceals a public hazard and allows potentially illegal conduct to continue with future employees in a vicious cycle of power imbalances, victimization, and suppression of legal remedies. This bill addresses contracts that contain confidentiality clauses, rendering those clauses unconscionable, void, and unenforceable in cases of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment. The bill would also make an employer liable if he or she attempts to enforce the confidentiality clause or if he or she retaliates against an employee for not agreeing to the clause. This liability would include payment of legal fees and costs. Additionally, the bill would give a victim up to three years after a violation to file a claim for a torts remedy, injunction, and fees and costs. Under the bill's provisions, abusive employers would no longer be able to use nondisclosure agreements to conceal illegal behav- ior or purchase the silence of their victims. It is an essential measure to ensure fair labor standards, prevent workplace hazards and miscon- duct, and protect employee rights.",2022: A398 (Rozic) - Labor 2021: A398 (Rozic) - Labor 2020: A626 (Rozic) - Labor 2019: A626 (Rozic) - Labor 2018: A8765 (Rozic) - Labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,"This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all contracts entered into, renewed, modified or amended on or after such date.",https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A01424&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

Low-income employees, specifically those in the retail industry, have continually faced challenges in the workplace that end up taking a toll on their personal lives. A report released by the Retail Action Project explores the impact unpredictable work schedules have on workers' lives. Some workers have described their frustrations of reporting to work as instructed and then being sent home early, and not receiving any pay for the time they initially made available. Others describe situations in which their jobs are compromised because of unpredictable scheduling practices by employ- ers that interfere with school schedules, child care availability, or even a second job.

The federal rate deducted and withheld is equal to the lowest effective federal tax rate, 10%. However, although the lowest state effective tax rate is 4%, the New York State rate of tax deducted and withheld from benefits is 2.5%. This means that the current rate of taxes withheld from unemployment benefits for New York State would not be enough to cover the taxes due for those in the lowest taxable income bracket ($0 to $8,500). This exact situation was especially prevalent during the pandemic when thousands of New Yorkers already facing joblessness were then also hit with unexpected tax bills at a time when they were ill equipped to pay them. This exacerbated their already dire financial situations by possi- bly subjecting those on unemployment to interest and penalties if the taxes were not paid when due. This legislation combats this situation as it raises the rate of New York State taxes withheld from unemployment benefits if elected from 2.5% to 4%. In addition, the legislation requires that an individual filing for unemployment is notified that even if they elect to have taxes withheld, they may still have an additional tax liability.",2021-22: A9462 Referred to Ways and Means,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This act shall take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A01573&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

These employers now pay $7.50 per hour to workers, so long as workers receive on average the difference between their reduced minimum wage and the statutory minimum wage in tips, which has led to a subminimum wage. Allowing for the tip credit has created many inequities in food service work. Employees who are not made whole by gratuities face arduous legal proc- esses to recover their owed wages, involving complicated record- keeping and inadequate legal remedies. Reliance on tips has also created an environment where workers are victimized, and in some cases, encouraged to turn a blind eye, to rampant discrimination and sexual harassment by clientele and managers. This results in annual restaurant employee sexu- al harassment claims to the EEOC at five times the rate of other indus- tries. Eight states (Alaska, California, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) have eliminated the tipped credit and required employers to pay the full minimum wage to employees. Those states have seen growth in the restaurant industry and a more equitable and experienced workforce. Washington, DC and Portland, Maine have also passed this via ballot initiative. New York's two-tiered wage system presents challenges for employers as well as workers. Unlike many other laws, wage and hour laws put the onus on employers to keep accurate records and follow the law, which take up large amounts of time and money in monitoring compliance. Maintaining the necessary records and compliance of a two-tiered wage system exposes employers to additional liability. In short, it is time for New York to join other states and improve the working conditions in the restaurant industry by eliminating the sub-mi- nimum wage. Employers would not be prohibited from allowing for restau- rant gratuities, but gratuities would no longer make up the difference between wages received from the restaurant and the actual minimum wage. Providing equity and fairness to restaurant workers would help reduce the wage gap and bring New York in line with many of its sister states in workers' rights and fairness on the job. This bill puts tipped work- ers in food service on a path to receive the full minimum wage by 2028. Additionally, the bill codifies wage increases ordered by former Gover- nor Cuomo for miscellaneous workers, such as nail salon workers, hair- dressers, car wash workers, etc. The bill will eliminate the subminimum wage for those industries by December 31, 2025. The bill also updates New York law considering recent changes in federal Department of Labor regulations on tip sharing. These changes now allow tip sharing between all employees, including those who work in ""back of house"" roles, such as cooks and dishwashers, and those who do not receive tips. However, this practice is currently barred under New York State law. This bill will allow tip sharing among all employees to ensure greater equity in wage earning between front and back of house employees.",2021-2022: S.808-A - Amend and Recommit to Labor/A.10203 - Referred to Labor STATE AND LOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,This act shall take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A01710&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS","Religious groups, such as the Old Order Amish, have been established as peaceful communities in New York State for generations. They are consti- tutionally guaranteed the right to practice their faith without inter- ference by the government. The Amish have been able to maintain their traditions, beliefs and practices without dispute or controversy in New York and have long been contributing members and an asset to their communities. The Amish are taught to work at an early age and are trained for the family business at the end of the eighth grade. They are mentored during work while engaged in activities such as woodworking, sawmilling and other work with heavy machinery. As currently enforced, NYS child labor laws prohibit the Amish from training their children in the very areas of employment that their livelihood has depended on for decades. Without the exemption provided in this bill, the whole Amish way of life is in threat of being altered. Further, the values of work and responsibility taught to each generation, which is an integral part of the Amish expe- rience, may be destroyed without the religious protection provided in this bill. New York State has a responsibility to ensure religious freedom, but to also ensure that minors are protected at all times. This legislation requires adult supervision of minors in the Amish community when working with heavy equipment. The Federal Government passed a similar religious exemption for the Amish under the Clinton Administration in 1998. That legislation allowed individual states to enact religious exemptions to their state labor laws. This bill would help protect the constitutional freedom of this religious community by providing a similar exemption in state labor law to federal labor law, while ensuring the safety of minors through their direct supervision.",A.60822011/2012- Held for consideration in Labor A.50412013/2014- Held for consideration in Labor A.51172015/2016- Held for consideration in Labor A.45362017/2018- Held for consideration in Labor A.54322019/2020- Held for consideration in Labor A.48682021/2022- Held for consideration in Labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,This legislation has no fiscal implications.,This act shall take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A01798&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"This legislation would ban the use of non-compete agreements for workers earning less than $15 an hour or $31,200 per year. As we push toward paying workers a ""livable"" minimum wage it is important that they enjoy the freedom to seek better employment as they hone skills in specific industries. The use of non-compete agreements when dealing with high level executives and others making high salaries is one thing, but recent news reports and federal legislation shedding light on the use of such agreements on sandwich shops and other traditionally low-wage jobs. This practice will hinder the upward mobility of workers trying to better themselves and their families. The MOVE Act's intention is to ensure low-wage workers are not being taken advantage of by being locked in to a low paying job with no options once skills have been learned and specialties obtained that could translate to higher paying jobs. Addi- tionally, the bill would require any company that uses non-compete agreements for employees not defined as ""low-wage"" under the bill, to disclose the use of such an agreement at the beginning of the hiring process.

Programs such as death survivor benefits, disability, retirement, including the cost of medical bills and health care, are not utilized because the tenets or teachings of their sect or religion do not allow for participation in such programs. This legislation would allow for the creation of a waiver form. Once signed by the employee, this waiver would allow for the employer to forgo payments on behalf of this employ- ee into the workers' compensation benefit system. The Federal government recognizes the religious beliefs and practices of the Amish and exempts them from having to contribute to the Social Security Fund.

A01944,A1944,"An act to amend the tax law, in relation to establishing a qualified transportation fringe benefits program",Stern,,To provide qualifying employers with the opportunity to offer employees an option to participate in a transportation benefits program to help offset their employees' commuting costs.,"Transportation benefits ordinances have been successfully enacted in numerous states and municipalities throughout the country. These polices have shown to be an effective tool in getting more commuters out of single occupancy vehicles and into vanpools or other mass transit options. According to a 2016 report to the California State Legislature, 44,000 cars were taken off the road each day after this policy was enacted in one of its major cities. This money saving initiative not only reduces congestion on busy highways, it also improves air quality in local communities. One of the major goals of a transportation benefits program is to help offset commuting costs for employees. This is typically accomplished via a pre-tax election program, which allows employees to elect to exclude from taxable wages and compensation, costs incurred for transit passes, commuter highway vehicle charges, qualified parking, and qualified bicy- cle commuting. It has been estimated that in some cases, this pre-tax transportation set aside can save employees up to forty percent of their annual commuting costs. Employers also save money (perhaps thousands of dollars annually) by reducing their payroll tax liability. This type of relief for both employees and employers is particularly critical given the recent feder- al tax law to limit state and local tax deductions, a policy change that disproportionately harms New York State residents.",2021-2022: A. 2234 Referred to Labor 2019-2020: A. 7264-A Referred to Labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,"This act shall take effect immediately, provided, however, that section one of this act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after it shall have become law; provided, further, that sections two and three of this act shall apply to taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2024.",https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A01944&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

Employers would need to furnish records within five business days of receiving a written request from an employee and notify employees when negative information affecting qualification for employment, promotion, transfer, additional compensation, or the possibility that an employee will be subject to disciplinary action is filed against them. Employees would also be able to submit a written statement into their personnel file if they disagree with its content, and to pursue an action for injunctive relief to remove false information. The Attorney General could bring an action, at their discretion, against violators of the bill and subject them to a fine between $500 and $2,500. Individual employees who face illegal discrimination or retaliation for exercising their rights under the statute may also bring a claim. This bill seeks to emulate Massachusetts in recognizing the basic right of employees to know what kind of reports are being officially filed about them and how this will impact their future employment prospects. It aims to inspire an open and transparent dialogue between employees and their supervisors while providing some recourse for employees to remove knowingly false or defamatory statements from their records. In providing a state right of action, this bill will also deter retaliatory use of personnel records to, for example, discredit or undermine employ- ees who may later come into conflict with their employers.

It is a David vs Goliath battle that New York State has a responsibility to address. Large corporate entities, such as Uber, Lyft, and Amazon, benefit from the current rules that classify workers as independent contractors rath- er than employees. These corporations rely on a steady pool of low-wage, no-rights workers to increase their bottom line at the expense of these workers who make them so profitable. By classifying them as independent contractors, they strip these workers of an avenue to have basic benefits - like vacation, sick pay, retire- ment, and health care for them and their families - addressed in any coherent fashion. This has led to the disturbing trend in which these workers have to rely on public assistance and benefits, as well as working two or three jobs, to make ends meet while many of these corporate giants that employ them offer these workers no benefits and pay nothing in taxes. This bill challenges this imbalance by giving these workers, who endure the misfortune of not having control of any workplace issues, an ability to be recognized as employees and to work together with their peers to improve their rights and working conditions.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"This legislation is named in honor of CJ Begins. CJ was a 23 year old young man from West Virginia who senselessly and tragically lost his life as a result of unsafe work site conditions and poor training of drill site workers at a vertical hydrofracking gas well site in Smyrna, New York on May 1, 2011. He suffered severe crush injuries as he and other workers were setting up a new drill site location. CI remained conscious after the accident and EMS attempted to arrange flight rescue to the nearest trauma center. A flight was not obtained and after an hour long ride to a Syracuse hospital, CI died as a result of his inju- ries during surgery. Drilling for oil and natural gas is an inherently dangerous practice. Drill workers arc placed in situations where accidents can easily result in severe injury and death. Despite constant exposure to severely toxic chemicals, dangerous heavy machinery, and excessive work hours for on-site drill workers and transportation employees, there are little to no regulations that protect these workers. In April 2008, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a report entitled ""Fatalities Among Oil and Gas Extraction Workers - United States, 2003-2006"" which revealed that ""increases in oil and gas extraction activity were correlated with an increase in the rate of fatal occupational injuries with an annual fatality rate of 30.5 per 100,000 workers during 2003-2006, approximate- ly seven times the rate for all workers (4.0 per 100,000 workers)"". Furthermore, the CDC report state that ""nearly half of all fatal inju- ries among these workers were attributed to highway motor-vehicle cras- hes and workers being struck by machinery or equipment"". In addition to the 2008 CDC report, recent news articles attest the extreme risks associated with this industry including not only drilling sire accidents but transportation related accidents involving trucks transporting water and or hydrofracking waste water to and from drill sites. The New York Times reported in May 2012 (Ian Urbina, May 1,4, 2012) that following their review of 50,000 inspection reports it was revealed that 'as the number of drilling rigs rose by more than 22 percent in 2011 from the prior year, die number of inspections at such work sites fell by 12 percent."" The article also highlighted the 2008 CDC report in stating that ""with the growth of the industry ... the fatality rate was increasing, meaning the relative risk was increasing"" and ""shifts grew longer, more inexperienced workers were hired and older rigs were being pressed into service."" Presently there are no specific work place safety rules that govern the many oil and gas drilling operations in New York State.

For more than one hundred years, New York's injured workers have relied on the Work- ers' Compensation Law for timely medical treatment and lost wage bene- fits. Those suffering from COVID19 should be treated no differently, and they certainly should not be forced to wait an entire year for their claims to be adjudicated. COVID-19 is a disease with devastating uncertainty, but what is certain is that those working on the frontline during these times of crisis are more likely to contract the disease than those who remain at home. New York's essential workers are providing those items necessary to allow the remainder of our population to survive by providing food, shelter, safety and medical treatment. As COVID-19 related cases are being filed, precedent exists allowing for the payment of medical and monetary benefits for these individuals. The existing law under section 21-a, however, allows carriers and self-in- sureds to commence payment without accepting or denying the particular case, giving these parties up to one year to make a decision. In the meantime, the injured and sick worker is left to wonder whether or not the medical bills are really going to be paid, whether the money they receive will have to be paid back, all without the means to effectively advocate for themselves. Similarly, COVID-19 presents unique medical issues that are emergent and life-threatening, impacting an unprecedented amount of workers who require the services of many medical providers who otherwise do not handle workers' compensation cases. These noble providers have no time to seek authorization to treat nor should their patients' treatments be stymied by preauthorization procedures during these times of crisis. Our frontline workers and public servants, including the grocery clerks, delivery people and everyone in between who have continued to dedicate their time and health to their work throughout these difficult times deserve to receive immediate medical care and to have their claims time- ly adjudicated without bureaucratic delays.

Illinois Univer- sity revealed that public safety responders suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at a higher percentage than the general popu- lation. The study, conducted by Heather Pierce and Michelle Lilly, cred- ited this higher percentage to ""significant duty-related trauma expo- sure."" Often the case many first responders who face PTSD, similar to our brave men and women who serve in our military often find themselves as a burden to their families and often take drastic measures such as suicide, alcohol or drug abuse, or abuse spouses and loved ones. This legislation specific intent is not only to assure proper compensation for work-related mental health illness, but to assure that these indi- viduals have access to proper psychological treatment.

The legislation amends the labor law and is intended to supersede any local laws allowing the practice. No municipal employee should be mandated to work a triple shift. In circumstances wherein a triple shift may be to the benefit of both the employer and the employee, or in the case of a true emergency, sufficient safeguards must be contractually negotiated. Currently, existing law allows certain municipalities to force workers to work in excess of 17 hours a day. This is particularly true in the case of the New York City Department of Corrections which has forced Correction Officers to work triple shifts. This practice is permitted under the NYC Administrative Code in emergency situations but has not been negotiated in contract and the practice is occurring regardless of declarations of emergency.",05/21/21 referred to labor 06/08/21 amend (t) and recommit to labor 06/08/21 print number 7763a 01/05/22 referred to labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,Immediately,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A02409&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

While the Executive Law currently covers manufactured homes, and provides certain consumer protections, it is an outdated law, having been passed in 2005 to implement the federal Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 2000, and therefore does not address NYC's current problem. Presently, modular construction is not subject to the same standards for plumbing, gas piping, electrical, and fire suppression work as construction done on site within New York City. This makes no practical sense and greatly increases the likelihood of code violations in such modular buildings. In 2014, the NYC Department of Buildings issued Buildings Bulletin 2014-003 stating that modular construction units must be certified either by NYC licensees or by a ""third party"" entity otherwise ""approved"" by the Department. However, there have been various instances of the third-party certification process failing, resulting in required repairs to such modular units by NYC licensees. To protect the public from potential safety and health issues, it is crucial that the actual work in these modular units be performed or certified by NYC-licensed entities familiar with the applicable laws, codes, and rules of the City of New York.

Volunteer firefighters and EMS volunteers are an important part of emergency services, but employment pressures can often make it difficult to recruit and retain them. Steps like this that help them protect their financial livelihood while serving their communities should encourage more volun- teers to stay on, and benefit everyone in the community.

This leaves them susceptible to contracting contagions and other dangers at a higher rate than the general public. For example, during the first few months of the COVID-1 9 pandemic in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) received more than 3,000 worker complaints regarding the coronavirus between January 2020 and April 2020 outlining the fear and danger essential workers faced on a daily basis.

This bill would promote more communication between employee and employer regarding expectations for work and require the employer to give more reasonable notice to the employee of changes in their work schedule.

The rate table determines an employer's tax obligation based on percentages related to the overall size of the fund index and an employ- er's positive or negative account balance. These rates are established in statute and require legislative action to adjust employers' unemploy- ment tax obligations. The 2021 employer contribution rate is assessed in the size of fund index column of less than 0 percent, the highest possi- ble rate column. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on busi- nesses in New York unemployment insurance premiums are sky rocking for employers. Earlier this year legislation was signed into law to prohib- it employer's experience ratings from being impacted as a result of COVID-19 related unemployment. While incredibly critical, this was only part of the solution to assist New York businesses. This legislation which is patterned after legislation that has become law in New Jersey would adjust New York's unemployment insurance employ- er contribution rate, which allows New York to begin replenishing the UI trust fund without overburdening businesses with high UI tax bills as they recover from the pandemic. Without legislative action, New York's businesses are paying the highest allowable rate determined in the employer contribution rate table. As long as New York's UI trust fund has a negative balance, employers will continue to pay the highest allowable rate. This legislation temporarily moves employers into a different rate column resulting in a lower tax rate than currently set in statute. The tax rate schedule steps up in 2023 and 2024 as busi- nesses may be in a better position to absorb higher UI tax bills.",A.7788 of 2021-22.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,"This act shall take effect immediately, provided that section 2 of this act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall have become a law and be applicable to new claims filed on or after such date.

A03061,A3061,"An act to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to the requirement for policyholders to provide 30-days notice to withdraw from the state insurance fund",Zebrowski,"Stirpe, Wallace, Benedetto, Colton, Brabenec",The purpose of this bill is to remove the requirement for New York State Insurance Fund (NYSIF) policyholders to provide a 30-day notice to with- draw from the Fund if they have secured insurance with another insurance carrier.,"The State Insurance Fund (SIF) is a non-profit agency of the State of New York established in 1914 to provide a guaranteed source of workers' compensation insurance coverage for employers in New York State. SIF is the largest single carrier of workers' compensation insurance in the State, with 40 percent of the market. Although a quasi-public agency, SIF was intended by the Legislature to be treated the same as a private insurance company. See Commissioners of State insurance Fund v. Low, 285 App. Div. 525, 138 N.Y.S 2d 437 (3rd Dept 1955) It is more closely equated to an insurance company than to a typical state agency Martin Minkiowtiz, PRACTICE COMMENTARIES, N.Y. Work. Comp. Section 76 (McKinney 1994) Despite the fact that SIF was intended to be treated as a private insur- ance company, it is not licensed by the New York State DFS, nor is it subject to the Department's oversight and regulation. As a result, SIF policyholders are put at a disadvantage when compared to policyholders of private workers' compensation insurers. As a result, SIF policyholders have reported various unfair practices which have gone unchecked. One common complaint is that SW take s retal- iatory actions against policyholders who seek to move their business from SIF to another coverage provider. Policyholders have reported aggressive and unfair tactics, such as SIF suddenly revising audits and questioning classifications in an effort to charge a departing customer, a higher premium. To rectify one of these inequities, the bill would place SIF on an even footing with other insurers providing workers' compensation insurance by removing the 30 day notice requirement placed upon policyholders who have secured a new insurance policy with another carrier. Currently, SIF policyholders that want to cancel their policy with SIF because they have found other coverage must provide SIF with 30 days advance written notice. During this notice period, policyholders report that SIF employs aggressive and retaliatory tactics in an effort to retain the business. Under the legislation, the 30 day notice requirement would only be required when you are not replacing a policy. If you are replacing a policy, the 30 day notice is not required and the effective date of cancellation is the effective date of the new policy. Therefore, you can move the policy at any point, even less than 30 days, if you can demon- strate that you have a replacement policy and provide them with notice. Moreover, if SIF policyholders cannot provide 30 days' notice, they find themselves subject to excessive short-rate penalty provisions that unfairly burden New York's businesses. It is simply unfair to require policyholders of the SIF to provide more notice than is required of policyholders of private carrier's. This statutory provision has outlived its usefulness and has become an arti- cle of anti-competitive protectionism for the Fund.","A.1295 of 2021-22, A.4350A of 2019-20, A.1598 of 2017-18, A.7742-A of 2015-16.",There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have become law.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A03061&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

This practice increases the cost of workers compensation in this industry for no purpose other than to increase revenues to the insurance company; it has caused individuals who would otherwise hire one or two employees to fire them in order to avoid the requirement of procuring a workers compensation policy; and it has led some horse owners to force their legitimate employee(s) to become part owners of a horse, which negates the necessity to cover those employees, but leaves the worker unprotected in case of injury.",2022 01/05/22 A1840 referred to labor 2019-2020 A4211 referred to Labor 01/09/17 referred to labor JUSTIFICATION,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None to the state.,This act shall take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A03531&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

A03901,A3901,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to benefits and supplemental wages",Fahy,,"AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to benefits and supplemental wages","In late January of 2019, it was reported that well-known internet media outlet Buzzfeed would be laying off 15% of their staff. Because Buzzfeed offers an 'unlimited' vacation time policy in its employment agreements, (defined in this bill as 'granted time'), employees were not entitled to any supplementary wages upon the termination of their contract, because, Buzzfeed argued, unlimited benefits by nature cannot accrue. Because of legal requirements in California, employees in that state were initially the only ones compensated for their non-monetary benefits. The decision was widely denounced by Buzzfeed employees and was eventually reversed, but highlights key weaknesses in New York and other states' protection of non-monetary benefits. This bill aims to remedy this and similar situations by clarifying the labor law as it relates to granted time, and prohibiting employee-em- ployer agreements that require the forfeiture of the full value of nonmonetary benefits upon the termination of employment. The State of California considers vacation time, granted time, and other non-monetary benefits and wage supplements to be part of an employee's compensation and non-payment of benefits within a timely manner is treated as a form of wage theft. New York labor law considers benefits like vacation time and other paid time off to ultimately be subject to each individual's employment agreement with their employer. This legis- lation leaves the terms of benefit agreements fully under the discretion of the parties subject to such a contract, but makes provisions stating that employees will not be compensated for unused benefits in that contract upon its' termination severable and unenforceable. Further, this legislation would require employers who agree to granted time provisions in employment contracts to pay a minimum of two weeks' pay upon the termination of such a contract.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS","The existing temporary disability insurance (TDI) program has remained unchanged since 1949, despite groundbreaking legislation in 2016 provid- ing job-protected paid family leave (PFL). Unlike PFL, the current TDI program does not provide employment or healthcare insurance protections, and does not supply sufficient income support for employees, with a cap of $170 per week. This bill will raise the benefit cap by implementing a progressive wage replacement up to 90% of an employee's average weekly wage. In addition, this bill will expand protections to cover all preg- nancy outcomes, as paid family leave does not cover miscarriage, abortion, or stillbirth. Further, this bill will provide for protections against retaliation by the employer such as reporting or threatening to report an employee's suspected citizenship or immigration status or the suspected citizenship or immigration status of a family member of the employee to a federal, state, or local agency. Updating the woefully out-of-date TDI program is especially urgent for women and birthing people. Nearly 30% of all benefit claims for one's own health are based on pregnancy outcomes. Birthing people across New York face a grave injustice due to the lack of adequate benefits follow- ing pregnancy outcomes. According to current New York state law, birth- ing parents grappling with the loss of a pregnancy or related compli- cations do not receive the necessary financial support or employment security needed for a restorative mental and physical recovery. With the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic upending the economic stabili- ty and health of millions of New Yorkers and widening pre-existing disparities, updating TDI will also address the ongoing Black maternal health crisis. Black birthing people are nearly three times as likely to die due to pregnancy complications than White birthing people in New York State. Updating TDI will alleviate the uncertainty and risk that Black workers face when taking time off so they don't have to sacrifice their health for financial stability. The updated paid leave system will empower vulnerable communities, including women, people of color, those who struggle substance use, veterans, and those impacted by COVID-19. These key updates will simply bring TDI up to date with paid family leave benefits, ensuring that New Yorkers will not be forced to choose between their health and paying their bills. By tackling disparities in health outcomes and providing overdue protections, this bill will provide greater protections against financial adversity for New Yorkers.

A04111,A4111,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to the prevention of construction employees being exposed to excessive heat",Lunsford,,Establishes standards and training requirements to help prevent and address excessive heat exposure for construction workers.,"On July 7, 2020, 35-year-old Tim Barber collapsed on the site of his job at the Genesee River Bridge Project in Geneseo. It was his second day. 911 was called, but Tim only made it four miles down the road in the ambulance before they had to pull over and try to treat his heat stress and heat exhaustion; sadly, he died from hyperthermia, never making it to the hospital' He had no previous medical problems. After his first day, Tim's father Jim noted Tim wasn't looking well and Tim said he wasn't given breaks for lunch or water. Jim's last words to Tim were ""You eat your lunch today. And you drink your water. And if you need to tell someone that, please do.""' Heat exposure poses a serious threat to millions of workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 1992 through 2016, heat stress has killed 783 workers and caused serious injuries to 69,374 workers.' Indeed, the fatality rate has increased in last 30 years due to higher temperatures from climate change' and this trend will only continue. ""People don't think of heat illness as an issue in western New York but it seems to me like we have more of these high-temperature, high- humidity days, which is all the more reason to raise awareness of the potential hazards of that,"" said Mike Scime, the director of OSHA's western New York office. In addition to saving the suffering of families like the Barbers by preventing unnecessary tragic deaths, there is proof that heat-related illness prevention plans and education reduce costs to workers compen- sation claims, resulting in savings to employers. After the implementa- tion of such a plan in ""a central Texas municipality,"" -the workers' compensation costs went down 50 percent for heat-related illness.""' In 2005, California implemented heat-related illness prevention legislation for farmworkers, which has ""lower(ed) the worker compensation costs for the employers and ensure(d) that there is better production because workers are feeling like they can produce in an environment where they do have the water, the rest, and the breaks and so forth.""' Heat-related illnesses are preventable,""'' yet so many workers remain vulnerable. Therefore, this legislation requires the Department of Labor with the Department of Health to set maximum heat exposure standards for workers on construction sites. Employers would also be required to develop common-sense prevention plans to combat heat-related illnesses, which would include access to water, emergency response plans, limita- tions on how long an employee can be exposed to heat, and more. Employ- ees and their supervisors would receive training on how to recognize and respond to heat-related illnesses, and no employee exercising their rights under this new law could be retaliated against by their employer. With these new standards, New York will ensure workers who are exposed to excessive heat will be provided with safe work conditions.",New Bill.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,"This act shall take effect on the one hundred and eightieth day after it shall have become a law.

YouthBuild has been working with at-risk young, people in New York State since 1978, when the program first started in East Harlem. There are currently 18 YouthBuild programs in New York State, 226 programs nationally and YouthBuilds in 21 countries worldwide. YouthBuild engages low-income, out-of-school youth for a two-year, all- inclusive process to earn high school equivalency (HSE), acquire job skills, certifications, and leadership competencies. YouthBuild provides opportunities for follow-up, placement services and stipends to out-ofs- chool, out-of-work youth, aged 16-24, as well as ongoing placement services and support for thousands of Youthbuild alumni. Since 1994, 41,000 units of affordable housing have been produced or upgraded by 150,000 YouthBuild students across the US. Over 5,000 of those students have been New Yorkers. YouthBuild is not just about creating affordable housing. YouthBuild is also one of the most effective and successful youth diver- sion programs in New York State. Most participants in the program are teens who are out-of-school or have made repeated appearances in our juvenile court system for actions directly or indirectly related to drug abuse. Instead of allowing these youths to burden our criminal justice and social services systems years on end, YouthBuild turns them into productive contributors to society. Many states nationwide have recognized the meaningful work of YouthBuild programs, and it is the intent of this legislation to fund the New York State programs, independent of federal funding.

This is unrealistic for many employees and contrary to the law in other States. Many employees who are not in sales have their bonus determined according to a formula based on firm profit.

A04297,A4297,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to establishing a claim for fraudulent inducement to enter into an employment relationship",Steck,,"To allow an employee to state a claim for fraudulent inducement by entering into an employment relationship based on false promises as to wages, benefits, or future intentions as to the duration or security of his or her employment, that were known by the employer to be false at the time the promise(s) was or were made, regardless of their status of being at at-will employee or otherwise. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS :","Far too often an employee begins an employment relationship based upon false claims or promises made by the employer that the employer knew were false at the time. These false claims can range from a false prom- ise of wages, benefits or the duration of employment. When employees have filed an action to recoup the last wages, benefits or durations of employment, courts have utilized the ""at-will"" status of the employee to deny the claims. The courts have required that the employee plaintiff show an injury separate from the loss of promised wages, benefits or duration of employment to establish a claim of false inducement. For example, in Smalley, appellant v. Dreyfus Corp., et al, Respondents, an at-will employee heard a rumor that the employer's parent corporation had made an offer to acquire a fund management company, the employer's chief executive officer said that no merger had occurred or was being considered. Relying on the assurance, other at-will employees accepted employment with one of the employer's departments. When the employer subsequently acquired the fund management company, it fired every member of the department. Consequently, the employees sued the employer for, inter alia, fraudulent inducement to enter into and remain in its employment. The Court of Appeals found that the core of the employees' claim was that they reasonably relied on the no-merger promises in accepting and continuing employment with the employer, and in eschewing other job opportunities. The employees alleged no injury separate and distinct from termination of their at-will employment. Absent injury independent of termination, the employees could not recover damages. Conversely, in Laduzinski, Appellant, v. Alvarez & Maisel Taxand LLC et al., Respondents, the appeals court found that the plaintiff pleaded an injury - separate and distinct from his termination, thus his claim survived defendant's motion to dismiss; the loss being his prior employ- ment and the pilfering of his client list. This was after defendant's induced him to quite his prior employment with the promise of ""plenty of work"" at their firm and a specific duration of employment. Instead, they lured him there with these false promises with the sole intent of taking his clients and summarily fired him. Had the plaintiff not had a sepa- rate actionable claim related to his losses, it would have been dismissed due to his ""at-will"" status as what happened in Smalley, appellant v. Dreyfus Corp., et al, Respondents). In Stewart, Appellant, v. Jackson & Nash, et al, Respondents, the court reversed a judgment that dismissed appellant attorney's fraud claim against appellees, law firm and partners, but affirmed the judgment that dismissed her negligent misrepresentation claim. Appellant was an envi- ronmental attorney who alleged that she was induced to quit her practice and to come work for appellees by representations that they had secured a large environmental client, that they were in the process of estab- lishing an environmental department, that appellant would work for the client and head the new department. The client and the new department never materialized, and appellant was eventually terminated by appel- lees. The court held that appellant had a valid claim for fraud in the inducement when the statements that appellees had secured the client and were starting the new department were not future promissory statements, but were representations of present facts, and the statement that she would head the new department was actionable if appellees never intended to perform that promise. The court held there was no basis for the negligent misrepresentation claim because appellees did not owe appel- lant a fiduciary duty due to her at-will employee status . An employee should be able to recover damages from the loss of wages, benefits or duration of employment from an employer that made false promises, and knew they were false at the time they were made. This legislation seeks to correct the over-extension of the at-will employ- ment status to dismiss all claims for false inducement when a separate and distinct injury claim cannot be shown.",New legislation,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None,Immediately,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A04297&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

Early diagnosis of HIV is critical to ensuring that people who are infected get treatment and thus can maintain a healthy life while reducing their risk of transmitting the virus to others. The CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested at least once and advises that people who have a higher risk of infection get tested at least once a year. However, many people do not get tested, or do not get tested frequently enough, due to time constraints as well as due to the stigmas, preju- dices and misinformation about HIV/AIDS. Mandating that every employee receive proper time to get an HIV test will help more people get the testing that they need. It will also help break the stigma and preju- dices that surround HIV/AIDS and prevent too many people from getting tested and treated. The bill also will help encourage employers to participate and organize HIV testing drives, which are critical to further increasing testing uptake.

A04477,A4477,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to extending the application of the New York state labor relations act to state grant recipients",Pretlow,,Provides protection against unfair labor practices committed by state grant recipients. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"Sections 704 and 706 of the New York State Labor Law contain provisions designed to prevent employers from committing the unfair labor practice of impeding unionization. Where the State Labor Board finds that an employer has committed an unfair labor practice as defined in section 704, the Board has the power to issue a cease and desist order, as well as to order the offending employer to 1) withdraw recognition from and refrain from bargaining collectively with an employee organization ""maintained or assisted by"" any unfair labor practice, 2) award back pay to employees who suffered unfair labor practices, 3) reinstate without back pay any employee who was illegally blacklisted, or 4) reinstate with or without back pay all employees who had been illegally blacklist- ed. This legislation is modeled on the Prevailing Wage Law, section 220-e of the Public Works Act. The Legislature has recognized that in the realm of public works, a state or municipality may in its discretion cancel a contract with an organization engaging in unfair discrimination. Amend- ing the labor law to include an analogous provision to prevent any other unfair labor practices will effectuate the Legislature's intent to protect employees, as articulated in both section 220-e and in section 700 of the Labor Law.

The Comp- troller has said that in order to make up the deficit, unemployment insurance payments for businesses could rise by as much as 9%. Such an increase would be devastating to employers who are still struggling to recover from the forced closures and costly COVID regulation imposed by the Executive during the last two years. Small Businesses did not create this deficit and they should not be asked to sacrifice any more money, simply because the state is unable to track its own expenditures and balance its own books. This legislation would establish in law a fixed contribution from employers to the unem- ployment insurance fund. Further, it would create a solvency fund in State Finance law, that could draw on other state revenues, settlement dollars or unencumbered Federal funds. The state this year has collected $5.9 billion more in tax revenue than originally projected. That would be an excellent place to start. The bottom line is that we cannot place any more burdens on small employers. Instead, we have to make their rates more predictable and put our own fiscal house in order.

It found that Walmart, McDonald's, Amazon and Dollar Tree are some of the main beneficiaries of federal benefits programs that is, a significant number of their employees receive federal aid through programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Meanwhile, these companies rack in sky-high profits: Walmart, for example, reported a net income of $1.76 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone. Further analysis documents the prevalence of businesses passing off responsibility for employee livelihood to the welfare state. An April 2015 report published by the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education analyzed State and federal spending for programs such as Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, SNAP, and the Earned Income Tax Credit. It found that American taxpayers in general, and New York State taxpayers in particular, are subsidizing companies that pay low wages to its employees to an alarming degree. According to the report, ""Overall, we find that between 2009 and 2011 the federal government spent $127.8 billion per year on these four programs for working families and the states collectively spent $25 billion per year on Medicaid/CHIP and TANF for working families for a total of $152.8 billion per year. In all, more than half - 56 percent - of combined state and federal spending on public assistance goes to working families"" (Jacobs, Perry and MacGill- vary). Further, 52 percent of all state spending supported working fami- lies (defined in this study as working for 27 or more weeks a year and 10 hours per week). Similarly, UC Berkeley concluded that in 2013, $3.3 million of public assistance went to annual expenditures on Medicaid/CHIP and TANF for working families in New York. It is clear that too many companies in New York are not paying their employees a living wage, relying on state and federal programs - and ultimately taxpayers - to fill the gap they have created. While the struggle to increase wages in New York State continues, this bill would add much-needed transparency to companies' treatment of their employees, and how our taxes are spent funding that which companies refuse to do themselves.

This led millions of Americans out of a job, losing their main breadwinners to the pandemic, and needing emergency unemploy- ment benefits. The safety nets provided by the State and Federal govern- ment leaves many-communities out of receiving unemployment and disabili- ty financial support. Namely, undocumented workers and some workers who work in the cash or underground economy are excluded from our unemploy- ment insurance system. To address this inequity the state passed an emergency $2.1 billion Excluded Workers Fund in the FY 2022 budget. An estimated 290,000 workers who were excluded from unemployment services were eligible for the emergency fund benefits. Still, this fund was exhausted quickly and does not fix the fact that some categories. of workers are still excluded from the federal/state unemployment system because of exclusions in the federal law or practical realities that leave groups of workers out in the cold. The Unemployment Bridge Program rectifies this exclusion by creating an unemployment insurance program, not only for undocumented workers, but also for others whose labor is not recognized by the existing system, hold 'non-traditional' forms of employment, including but not limited to domestic workers, landscaping and groundskeeping workers, day laborers, and domestic construction workers who are paid off the books; street vendors, freelancers, self- employed workers; and workers recently released from incarceration or .immigrant detention who cannot use their prison or detention labor to qualify for unemployment benefits. To ensure that the newly established fund is funded in a way that does not impact additional spending, this legislation will also create a digital ad tax that will require major advertising platforms to pay a small portion of their annual revenue from digital ads viewed within the state. The new fund establishes in-depth requirements and procedures making it possible for members of these communities to apply and receive benefits for their ongoing unemployment. Given the variety of circumstances these workers face, this legislation establishes fair and accessible methods of employment and identity verification through a point system.

This law applies to projects financed through state grants but does not apply to any state loans, and developers have found this loophole as a way to bypass wage requirements. Since this law went into effect, many projects have received a significant amount of state dollars that were not subject to any requirements simply because there is a repayment requirement. For example, a recent project at 475 Bay Street in Staten Island avoided prevailing wage requirements despite receiving a first mortgage loan of $99,865,000 from the New York State Housing Finance Agency and an annual subsidy from the New York Empire State Supportive Housing Initiative. Construction workers on these substantial projects, such as 475 Bay Street, should be subject to the requirements under the prevailing wage law since taxpayer dollars still cover costs.

SUMMARY","College athletes face exploitative and unfair labor practices by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this section as the ""NCAA"") and its member institutions, primarily through the denial of the basic economic and labor rights of such athletes, which the NCAA and its member institutions have justified by defining college athletes as amateurs. The NCAA and its member institutions have denied college athletes a fair wage for their labor by colluding to cap compensation; they maintain strict and exacting control over the terms and conditions of college athletes' labor; and they exercise the ability to terminate an athlete's eligibility to compete if the athlete violates these terms and conditions. College athletes exhibit the markers of employment as established under the common law definition of the term ""employee:"" They perform a valuable service for their respective colleges under a contract for hire in the form of grant-in-aid agreements; these agree- ments assert significant control over how athletes perform their work and the conditions under which they work; and they receive compensation in the form of grant-in-aid and stipends in exchange for their athletic services. In light of recent NCAA rules changes, New York State enacted a law that allows for college athletes to be compensated for the use of their name, image, and likeness (NIL). The goal of this law is to give college athletes the ability to take advantage of NIL sponsorship opportunities in exchange for the use of their NIL, and to eliminate the fear that a NIL deal will cause an athlete to lose their scholarship. This legis- lation takes the next step in bringing parity between the college and professional sports industries by empowering athletes to advocate for fair pay and safe working conditions. Currently, collegiate athletes, although the foundation of the multi- billion dollar sports enterprise in the United States, do not have a proper method to advocate for improved working conditions, fair wages, or benefits. This legislation would empower collegiate athletes within the state to participate in various labor agreements granting them simi- lar rights as other industry rank and file employees.

A05348,A5348A,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to payment of wages",Simon,"Santabarbara, De Los Santos, Reyes, Ardila, McDonough",To bolster protections against wage theft for employees by clarifying that all bonuses and other forms of employment remuneration that are not purely discretionary count as wages.,"New York's protections against wage theft, contained largely in Article 6 of the Labor Law, are some of the strongest in the nation. Among other things, the statute prohibits the withholding of wages, benefits, and wage supplements, bars the untimely payment of wages, mandates writ- ten notice of the terms and conditions of an employee's pay, and provides additional administrative remedies to certain workers earning less than $900 per week through the Department of Labor. Despite the strong language of Article 6, however, judges in New York often narrowly interpret its prohibitions against wage theft - which has necessitated several amendments to the statute, including the passage of Ch. 397 in 2021 to close a judicially-created loophole by-declaring that there is ""no exception to liability under SECTIONS 193 AND 198 for the unauthorized failure to poy wages, benefits and wage supplements."" A closely related problem is that section 190's broad definition of ""wages"" continues to be narrowly interpreted by most courts, which hold that mandatory bonuses, even if clearly promised ahead of time by the employer, do not count as wages under Article 6 so long as the bonus can be tied to any factor other than the individual employee's performance. The way that our modern economy works, however, bonuses are rarely due to just one employee's individual performance. A bonus may be tied to the performance of a group (as in Doolittle v. Nixon Peabody LLP, where multiple lawyers at Nixon Peabody LLP had billed hours for a client that the plaintiff had secured for the firm through a personal relationship), the performance of the company as a whole, or an external factor. A soft beverage portfolio manager at an investment firm, for example, may earn a bonus based partially on how they managed their portfolio, but also how the market fared overall for soft beverage sales that year. This legislation would say that unless the employer clearly told the portfo- lio manager from the outset that their bonus was purely discretionary, it must be paid timely and in full, subject to all of the provisions of Article 6, despite the fact that the bonus can be tied to a factor other than the portfolio manager's individual performance. If the bonus is truly discretionary, the employer must notify the employee in a clear, prominent, uncontradicted manner that such compen- sation is only payable, if at all, in the employer's sole and absolute discretion. Effectively, this is a ""truth in compensation"" requirement which will improve the functioning of the labor markets by creating increased transparency. It will also avoid placing honest and responsi- ble employers who either pay what they promise, or label purely discre- tionary bonuses as purely discretionary-at a competitive disadvantage relative to employers who make representations designed to entice employees to work for them without necessarily intending to pay those employees accordingly. Section three of the bill provides that the failure of an employer to provide employees with written terms of employment, as required in Section 195 of the Labor Law, upon request shall give rise to a rebutta- ble presumption that the terms presented by the employee are the agreed-upon terms - a provision that already exists for commissioned salespeople in § 191(c). Finally, sections four and five of the bill address further judge-creat- ed loopholes by clarifying that the criminal penalties for wage theft created in Sections 198-b and 198-c of Labor Law were never intended to limit the civil penalties available under Section 198. This bill represents common sense fixes to a judicial narrowing of our state's landmark wage theft protection laws. Excluding promised (i.e., nondiscretionary) employment compensation from the definition of ""wages"" unless it is ""expressly linked"" to an employee's performance is an archaic notion that is out-of-step with the realities of a modern econo- my, where production and service results depend on the combined efforts of many people rather than a solitary individual. The courts' current narrow definition of ""wages"" leads to costly, protracted, and unnecessary litigation. It also makes it hard for many unpaid employees to find counsel willing to take their case on a contin- gency fee basis. It is the sponsor's hope that in clarifying that all bonuses and other forms of supplemental compensation that are not purely discretionary count as wages, despite the fact that such bonus or compensation may be due to more than one person's job performance, will better align the protections of Article 6 with how modern workplaces function in reality. Additionally, further incentivizing employers to provide written terms of employment, as they are already required to do under law, will lead to healthier and better-functioning workplaces across the state while bolstering the remedies available to victims of wage theft under Labor Law.","2023: A5348 - referred to Labor S4973 - Passed Senate, died in Assembly",There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None,"This act shall take effect immediately and apply to all actions filed on or after such effective date, provided, however, that section six of this act shall take effect on the same date as chapter 433 of the laws of 2023.",https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A05348&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

New York's fashion industry employs 180,000 people, accounting for 6% of the city's workforce and generating $10.9 billion in total wages. New York Fashion Week, a semi-annual series of events when fashion collections are shown to buyers, the press and the general public, has long been one of the city's economic drivers, generating close to $600 million in income each year. And yet, the creative workforce behind the industry's success - namely, models, influencers, and performing artists - are not afforded basic labor protections in New York. This is due to the multi-level structure of hiring of these profes- sionals as independent contractors through management companies. Unlike talent agencies, modeling agencies consider themselves to be management companies under New York State General Business Law § 171(8), known as the ""incidental booking exception,"" thereby allowing them to escape licensing and regulation. This leaves models unprotected outside the terms of their individual contracts, which tend to be exploitative and one-sided in favor of the management company, and creates a lack of financial transparency and accountability when it comes to issues of both payment and sexual abuse. For example, models and creatives often wait months, even years to get paid for jobs through management compa- nies, which deduct various unexplained fees from their earnings. Model management companies house young models in overpriced model apartments, and hold them to exclusive, multi-year contracts without any obligation to book them work or pay them in a timely manner, which ensnares them in cycles of debt and makes them highly vulnerable to other forms of abuse, including trafficking. The Fashion Workers Act would address these issues by closing the legal loophole by which management companies escape accountability and create basic protections for fashion's creative workforce. As New York's fash- ion industry begins to recover from pandemic-related downfall, New York State must ensure the industry's workers - many of whom are young, immi- grant women and girls - are fairly compensated for their work and protected from abuse.",2022: A9762-A - 2022: Referred to Labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,TBD,This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after it shall have become law,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A05631&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

Employers often assert that this is necessary for reasons associated with professionalism, efficien- cy, and business needs. It is often necessary to stand while performing work, but it also true that prolonged standing with minimal or no breaks is not a necessity in many workplaces. According to a review by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,' prolonged stand- ing at work can even lead to numerous negative health outcomes. They cite studies showing that-prolonged standing lower back pain, fatigue, muscle pain, tiredness, and body soreness, and can even pose risks of Cardiovascular problems and other serious issues. There are many changes that employers can make to allow employees more options besides simply standing for hours on end during their shifts; the simplest of these is to provide employees who are reasonably able to perform their work sitting the option to do so. This legislation presents a reasonable step in this direction: requiring employers to provide employees who can sit with the ability to do so and preventing employers from constructing workplaces to force prolonged standing unnecessarily. This simple change to New York's labor laws will provide relief and increase produc- tivity for many of our hardest working neighbors.

SUMMARY,"This legislation allows mothers, non-birthing parents, and family members of the person affected by the result of any pregnancy outcome time to properly recover. Types of pregnancy outcomes may include live birth, stillbirth, miscarriage, spontaneous abortion, and induced abortion. New York has a striking absence of laws protecting the work- place rights of people who have suffered a miscarriage or fetal loss. Importantly, a number of scholars and advocates have noted how laws that prohibit pregnancy discrimination have fallen short in reaching discrim- ination on the basis of pregnancy outcome. A pregnancy loss is often an unforeseen circumstance that can negatively impact a person's well-being. Further, if appropriate recovery time is not allowed, there can be serious financial, mental, and physical impli- cations for the birthing person and their family members.

Unfortunately, very few lawyers will take on UI cases because clients often fail to pay their attorney's fee-even after they win an award. In Workers' Compensation cases, the attorney's fee is withheld to ensure that lawyers are paid for their work. UI cases don't follow this model, and by the time UI benefits are paid after a successful appeal, the claimant often uses the settle money to pay off their other outstanding bills first. While the attorney may have won the case, there is no guar- antee they will receive payment for their work, and most lawyers don't feel it's worth the effort to chase down their fee by suing their client. This bill will bring the way attorneys are paid for UI cases in line with the way they are paid in Workers' Compensation cases, by withhold- ing the attorney's fee from the benefits awarded to the worker. The fee will be contingent on a successful outcome. The attorney fee will be fifteen per cent (15%) of the benefits awarded. The attorney may not charge for the attorney's out-of-pocket expenses such as travel and office costs. The attorney and the claimant must execute a retainer agreement stating these terms with a sample retainer agreement to be prepared by the Department of Labor.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"Like other forms of insurance, title insurance, which guarantees home- buyers against claims of prior liens against property they intend to purchase, is regulated by New York State. Currently, title insurance is available through only private entities and costs citizens, on average, 51.2 billion, in order to guarantee payments of 550 million, according to 2007 statistics. Because title insurance is a requirement of home purchase, citizen are forced to pay accept the prices set by private industry, but that require the approval of the New York State Insurance Department. New York State should take a greater interest in protecting citizens from the overpricing of something the state requires of home- buyers. For example, the State of Iowa has prohibited the private sale of title insurance, allowing the government to set rates and ensure that its citizens are offered standard price.

A06108,A6108A,"An act to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to paid fami- ly medical leave",Ardila,,To provide justice for employees discriminated against for utilizing or requesting to utilize New York's paid family leave program and eliminate the requirement that an employee request reinstatement before filing a complaint of discrimination.,"New York's landmark paid family leave (PFL) law, first enacted in the FY2017 budget (Ch. 54 of 2016, Part SS) pays 67% of an employee's Aver- age Weekly Wage (AWW), which is the average wage of the last eight weeks prior to taking leave, for up to 12 weeks. Employees can take PFL so long as they have worked at least 26 weeks or 175 days, depending on if they are full- or part-time, and have a ""qualifying event,"" defined as the birth or adoption of a child, the placement of a child in foster care, needing to care for a child because of a physical or mental disa- bility, needing to care for a close relative because of a serious health condition, or assisting a loved one when a family member is deployed on active military service. The vast majority of private sector employees in New York State are automatically provided PFL. New York's paid family leave also provides important safeguards against retaliation for employees wishing to use it. Under Workers Compensation Law § 120, an employer is not allowed to discriminate against an employ- ee who has requested or used PFL. Under Workers Compensation Law § 203-b, employers are required to reinstate employees coming off of PFL to their former position or a comparable one with similar pay and bene- fits. Employees experiencing mistreatment under these provisions of Workers Compensation Law can file a request for reinstatement on ""Form PFL-DC-119,"" and wait 30 days for a response. If the employee receives no response or is dissatisfied with the response, they can then file a second form ""Form PFL-DC-120"" alleging discrimination/retaliation and wait 45 days for a hearing before a Workers Compensation Law Judge. The employee may be entitled to reinstatement, back wages, and attorneys' fees if they prevail. The employer can be liable for up to $500 in penalties (see: https://paidfamilyleave.ny.aov/protections). The lack of any formal remedy for violations of WCL § 120 and § 203-b outside of the backlogged workers' compensation system means that many attorneys can't or won't handle claims of PFL-related retaliation, deny- ing aggrieved workers the recourse they enjoy for any other type of disparate treatment claim such as workplace discrimination based on protected class characteristics under the New York State Human Rights Law. Additionally, the illogical administrative requirement, laid out in 12 CRR-NY 380-8.2, that an employee must request their job back before filing a complaint of discrimination, belies the reality that many employees are unable or unwilling to return to their former jobs by the time they resort to filing a complaint. Furthermore, many real-life forms of PFL-related discrimination, such as insults and jokes at the jobsite, harsher feedback, requests to attend meetings in person that can easily be done virtually, removal from high-level projects that the employee was previously working on, or sabotaging of breastmilk pumping at the worksite, can all occur while someone is still actively employed - and so the requirement to request reinstatement before filing a complaint makes no sense, as the employee has not left their job and so there is nothing to be reinstated to. Furthermore, WCL § 120 prohibits discrimination for requests to merely use PFL, which would also occur while someone is still at the job site. The legislature very clearly intended to bar PFL discrimination in all of its forms when it first drafted these provisions in 2016 - yet in practice they provide justice only for those who have both actually left their jobs (where in all likelihood the retaliation they faced was a major factor in their deci- sion to leave) and then are somehow willing and able to ask for it back. This bill rectifies both of the above problems by creating a private right of action, separate and apart from the Workers Compensation Board (WCB), for violations of WCL § 120 and § 203-b. It also clarifies that an employee should not be required to request reinstatement before pursuing corrective action through WCB or a civil court. This bill provides two commonsense reforms to PFL. A worker treated unfairly for using or attempting to use paid family leave should be afforded the opportunity to pursue their claim without the need to request reinstatement to a position they may no longer have any desire to return to or may never have left in the first place. Secondly, the worker should be granted full access to our state's civil court system, able to pursue claims of retaliation in the context of PFL the same as they can for many other types of illegal discrimination in our state's labor laws.",None,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,TBD,This act shall take effect immediately and apply to all complaints and actions filed on or after the effective date.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A06108&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

A06192,A6192A,"An act to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to removing labor market attachment requirements for certain disability cases",Cruz,"Colton, Gibbs, Burdick, Epstein, Zinerman, Zaccaro, Seawright, Tapia, Simone, Cunningham, Anderson,
Burgos, Clark, Davila, Reyes, Simon",The purpose of this bill is to eliminate the need to show a Labor Market Attachment (LMA) to receive Workers' Compensation and remove the suspen- sion of benefits as consequence for an inability to meet LMA. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"Labor market attachment (LMA) is a requirement in the workers' compen- sation system for temporarily, partially disabled workers to demonstrate they are seeking employment they can perform while disabled. The Work- ers' Compensation Law itself does not require injured workers to look for work while receiving indemnity benefits, or payments for lost time. However, due to case law, workers must demonstrate labor market attach- ment or their lost time payments can be suspended. LMA is routinely raised as a cost-savings measure by all workers' compensation insurers to stop paying wage replacement benefits in work- ers confirmed to have a work-related disability of some degree. In addition, there is no acknowledgment that workers face increased diffi- culty reattaching to the labor market after a work-related injury, espe- cially while still recovering and in need of ongoing medical treatment and sometimes surgery. In addition, the requirement to demonstrate an attachment to the labor market is a difficult burden for older employees with limited vocational skills and education as well as for workers who are undocumented. While immigration status is not a factor to obtaining workers compensation benefits, it is a factor to keeping them. For exam- ple, undocumented workers, who may only have experience with physical labor, have great difficulty finding sedentary work when they have limited language skills, relevant work experience or legal work authori- zation. Lastly, while the Board has vocational rehabilitation services available to workers, we rely on existing state workforce resources provided by the Department of Labor or State Education Department which fall short of addressing the needs of disabled workers who are unable to return to their previous work due to their medical impairments.

According to Wood (2013), the classification of employ- ees as independent. contractors has been a widespread labor practice recently investigated by the United States Department of Labor and the New York Attorney General. The Department of Labor has collected over $18.2 million in back wages from 19,000 employees who were placed in the wrong category. Other states have entered into deals with the DOT, to crack down on this practice. The AFL-CIO (2014) suggests that millions of employees have been hired as independent contractors by employers in order to cut costs bypass federal anti-discrimination and collective bargaining laws, exploit undocumented laborers, or avoid having, to pay for health benefits. This practice is widespread across industries, occurring at 30 percent of firms audited by the Department of Labor; over 700,000 workers in New York could be reasonably assumed to be misclassified. In 2007, one in four New York City construction workers was -estimated by the Fiscal Policy Institute to be operating under false terms. The federal govern- ment was estimated to have lost $2.72 billion due to employees filed as independent contractors in 2006 (AFL-CIO, 2014). These figures, indicate that current labor laws contain glaring inadequacies which allow a significant portion of New York's labor force to fall through the cracks, often without legal recourse.

This employment data was shared with the City of New York from 1989 to 2003 and was crucial to City agencies' ability to perform analyses, such as the evaluation of economic develop- ment strategies, important to the ongoing vitality of the City. In 2004, the State Department of Labor determined that it was not statutorily authorized to share this employment data. Lack of access to this data has increasingly impeded several. City agencies' ability to generate the accurate and detailed analyses necessary to the development of sound economic, fiscal, and environmental and land use policies. The employment data, the analyses of that data and the policies and programs that grew out of those analyses contributed directly to strength of the City's economy and the welfare of its citizens.. As noted, New York City agencies were recipients of this employment data for many years. The proposed bills by clarifying the State Department of Labor's statutory authority to share the employment data, will merely restore the pre-2004 status quo'. In addition, the confidentiality of the data will be secure. Under N.Y. Labor Law § 537(g) (i), the Commis- sioner has the authority to require that requesting agencies sign agree- ments requiring that the data be kept confidential. Furthermore, requesting agencies will be required to demonstrate to the Commission- er's satisfaction that the agencies_have adequate security safeguards in place to avoid any unauthorized disclosure. without this crucial data, the activities and effectiveness of several City agencies would be significantly hampered. For example, this data enables the Department of City Planning to analyze the socioeconomic impacts of actions requiring environmental review pursuant to the State. Environmental Quality Review Act (""SEQRA"") and the City Environmental Quality Review (the ""CEQ R""); it enables the Department of Small Business Services to target businesses for which direct assistance is appropriate, to promote finan- cial and economic opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses, and to provide New Yorkers with workforce development opportunities, including employment training; it enables the City's Office of Manage- ment and Budget to analyze proposed legislation for its cost and revenue implications and to forecast the tax revenues that the City's economy will generate; and it enables the Economic Development Corporation to evaluate an industry's strength in a particular neighborhood, to deter- mine the nature of existing businesses that could be displaced as part of a development Project, and to identity specific locations that serve as focal points, for particular industries. Lack of access to this data would have far reaching effects in terms of the City's overall economic health and on the welfare of its individual citizens.

Epstein, Shrestha",This bill improves injured worker's access to timely and quality treat- ment under the Workers' Compensation Law.,"This bill works to restore the overall goal of the Workers' Compensation Law, which is ""the provision of a swift and sure source of benefits to injured employees or the dependents of deceased employees."" Crosby v. Workers' Comp, 57 N.Y.2d 305, 313 (N.Y. 1982). First, this legislation also raises the pre-authorization limit of $1,000 to $1,500 to account for the increased prices of medical care and to help eliminate unneces- sary delays in the provision of routine tests and procedures. Second, this bill makes clear that the Board's ""list of pre-authorized procedures"" or Medical Treatment Guidelines or ""MTGs"" is to be used only as a list of treatment not requiring carrier approval, not as a means to automatically deny any procedures not on the list. Based on industry data, at this time, only treatments within the MTGs are receiving authorization, which others consistently get denied as not medically necessary despite the authorization request having come from a medical provider. This has led to a drastic decrease in doctors willing to participate in the Workers' Compensation system - providers often will not perform a pre-authorized procedure without receiving authorization for fear that the carrier will still deny the bills. The legislative history supporting the adoption of the list of preauthorized procedures in 2007 indicates that its purpose was to reduce impediments to prompt diagnostic and treatment measures. The sooner injured workers receive their treatment, the sooner they can return to work. Unfortunately, that has not been the reality as implemented by the Board.' Due to complexity of the MTGs and the authorization system, many injured workers and their providers experience undue delays and have stopped working with Workers' Compensation altogether, transferring the costs to private insurance. Finally, this bill restores claimants' right for payment of services by out-of-network providers the right to which was upheld by our court system and then eliminated by the Workers' Compensation Board. The Court in Rivera v. North Central Bronx Hospital, 101 A.D.3d 1304 (3d Dept. 2012) determined that even if an injured worker failed to use the diagnostic testing network, the carrier would pay the out-of-network provider at the negotiated network rate pursuant to the language and intent of the law. However, the Workers' Compensation Board has adopted regulations which contravene this holding. See 12 NYCRR 440.8(c). These regulations preclude any payment to any out-of-network provider, making it more difficult for injured workers to obtain testing. This legis- lation allows injured workers to obtain treatment in a timely manner, while also reducing costs of treatment by requiring out-of-network providers to accept payment at the carrier's negotiated network rate. i Notably, this was the concern of the dissenting judges in Matter of KioKigin v. New York State Workers' Compensation Board, 24 NY3d 459 (2014) where a split Court of Appeals upheld the Board's creation of the MTGs. In the dissent, Judge Rivera noted, ""to the extent the Board's regulations establish a variance scheme that predetermines that all treatment not included on the preauthorized list of services is presump- tively not medically necessary, it imposed a burden on Kigin and other claimants inconsistent with the statute's language and underlying purpose.""

A06877,A6877,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to remedies for payment of wage violations",Lavine,,To reduce the harmful effects that the Vega ruling will have on small businesses by aligning damages for violations of section 191 of the labor law with penalties already existing in Section 218 of the labor law.,"In September of 2019, the First Department ruled in Vega v. CM & Associ- ates Construction Management, LLC that manual workers who were paid in full but at a frequency other than weekly could bring a lawsuit seeking liquidated damages. The court's rationale in Vega suggests that the holding extends beyond manual laborers to all employees covered under the frequency of pay requirements in Section 191. Section 191 of the Labor Law regulates how frequently certain non-exempt employees must be paid. For manual workers and railroad workers, wages must be paid weekly. Clerical and other workers must be paid at least semi-monthly and commission sales persons must be paid at least once a week. Prior to the Vega decision, it was generally understood that there was no private cause of action for a violation of Section 191. That section does not expressly include a private right of action and Section 198, the labor law's remedy section, allows relief for unpaid wages but not for late-paid wages. Additionally, the NYS Department of Labor (NYS DOL) who enforces violations of the labor law never advised or suggested that a private cause of action existed for wages paid late in violation of Section 191's frequency of payment requirements. As a result, consensus was that the only consequence for violating the frequency of pay requirements was the possibility that the NYS DOL could assess a penalty pursuant to labor law section 218. The fine for a frequency of payment violation under Section 218 is $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000 for first, second, third, and subsequent violations. The Vega holding allowing for liquidated damages for violations of Section 191 is concerning for small busi- nesses. Liquidated damages are typically measured as the full amount of the underpayment. In a frequen- cy of payment case, the liquidated damages would be the total amount of wages the employee received late for the entire duration of the statute of limitations (6 years). This could result in small businesses closing because they owe hundreds of thousands of dollars and individual owners remaining on the hook because there is personal liability for violations of the labor law. This bill seeks to protect workers and employers by amending Section 198 Of the labor law to acknowledge that there is a private right of action for violations of Section 191, frequency of payment, but that damages are limited. The bill caps damages at $1,000 for the first violation, $2,000 for the second violation, $3,000 for third and subsequent violations. This penalty scale is consistent with the fines that NYS DOL can assess pursuant to labor law section 218.",2022: S.9511 (Thomas) - Referred to Rules..,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None to the state.,This act shall take effect immediately,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A06877&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y
A06899,A6899,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to maximum hours for home care aides",Epstein,Mitaynes,To protect home health aides from being required to work unreasonable work schedules in any day or week and ensure they are not pressured by employers with disciplinary action.,"Home care workers in New York are essential to maintaining the daily well-being and long-term care of older adults and people living with chronic health conditions or disabilities. Home care workers and personal care aides are among the fastest growing occupations in the state. New York State employs more than 210,000 home care workers and they rank as NYC's single largest occupational group. The demand for home care workers will only accelerate with a growing aging population. It has become increasingly apparent that many home care workers are required by employers to work mandatory 24-hour shifts to care for people who have been approved for around-the-clock care. Home care work- ers report that they are often required to work 24-hour shifts consec- utively in a week. The growth in mandatory 24-hour shifts can endanger the health and safety of both home care workers and care recipients. Studies have shown that prolonged periods of wakefulness (17 hours with- out sleep) can significantly impair hand-eye coordination, decision-mak- ing skills and memory. Workers' sleep is shorter, lighter, more frag- mented and less restorative than normal sleep at night. Twenty-four hour shifts are equally detrimental to care recipients. When home care work- ers are too fatigued or become chronically ill from lack of proper rest and sleep, care recipients - those approved for 24-hour care and among the neediest of clients - are less likely to receive proper treatment and safe care. They face a higher risk of injury when workers are mentally or physically fatigued to safely move them or assist with medi- cally-related tasks. Further, burn-out, occupational related illnesses and high turnover among workers lowers the quality and continuity of care. The labor of home care workers contributes to the well-being and long term care of New York's aging community and people living with chronic health needs or disabilities. Home care workers are also an important component of the state's economic growth. It is thus declared to be the public policy of this State to protect home care workers from 24-hour shifts in order to safeguard the health, safety and general well-being of home care workers and their families, as well as care recipients, consumers and the public.",2020: A8064A/S06640 referred to labor/REFERRED TO RULES 2019: A8064A/S06640 - referred to labor/REFERRED TO LABOR,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined,Immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A06899&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

There are multiple protections in the bill to address parental approval, academic criteria and labor law concerns. This legislation would allow more young people to get paid to perform this work in their communities, as well as fill what is in many communities a shortage of youth sports officials. SUMMARY","In New York State, anyone under the age of 18 must show an employment certificate before they can work. These certificates, commonly known as ""working papers,"" are issued by school districts and are valid for two years from the date of issue. In order to qualify for an employment certificate, applicants must present evidence of age, a parental or guardian signature, certificate of physical fitness, a pledge of employ- ment, their school record and their social security number. New York State labor laws stipulate that no minor under the age of fourteen shall be employed in or in connection with any trade, business or service. However, numerous exceptions have been created to allow minors to work before the age of fourteen. For instance, an eleven year old may be employed as a newspaper carrier. Provisions also exist to allow twelve and thirteen year olds to work on a family farm, family market stand or as a bridge caddie. Child performers and models are also allowed to work under the age of fourteen. All of these exceptions are allowed as long as they comply with either the Education Law work requirements for minors or provisions contained within the Arts and Cultural Affairs Law. When exceptions have allowed children under the age of fourteen to be permitted to work in a certain field, the amendment has also provided provisions allowing youth ages fourteen through seventeen to be employed in that same field without a certificate of employment or permit. Simi- lar to that of the exclusion for a bridge caddie, this exception allow- ing twelve and thirteen year olds to be employed as a referee, umpire or official at a youth sporting event, accompany provisions allowing those ages fourteen through seventeen to do so without an employment certif- icate or permit. Currently, many, youth sport leagues are experiencing shortages in referees or umpires. For example, many youth hockey leagues are trying to cope with a significant shortage of youth referees. This legislation would allow more young people to enjoy contributing to youth sports regardless of their athletic ability and to learn the value of gainful employment.",2021-22: A7810; referred to labor. 2019-20: A28; referred to labor. 2017-18: A189; referred to labor. 2015-16: A6409; referred to labor. 2013-14: A8457; referred to labor. 2011-12: A7484; referred to labor. 2009-10: S6652; referred to labor.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,:.

Section 21 of the labor law is amended by adding a new subdivision 16. This addition mandates the Department of Labor shall produce a report to analyze the change in living costs, changes in poverty and child poverty for households that include one or more workers, and the adequacy of the minimum wage. The report shall also compare the current and projected future value of the state's various region-based minimum wage levels with the minimum wages in other high-cost states.

Section 2. The act shall take effect immediately. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORIGINAL AND AMENDED VERSION (IF APPLICABLE)","In New York State, roughly one million workers--16.4% of New York State's workforce- earn the minimum wage. The State has an obligation to ensure the legislature has access to accurate data on the cost of living and the adequacy of the current minimum wage. Historically, yearly gains in inflation have decreased the value of the minimum wage, chipping away at workers' purchasing power and leading to hardship for many. Each year that inflation increases and wages at the bottom do not, workers in the lowest-paying positions struggle to pay bills, feed their families, and access transportation. Across the state, minimum wage workers are disproportionately women and people of color, groups that also face significant barriers to advancement. This bill mandates the Department of Labor, by September 13th, to prepare and submit an annual report on the cost of living, poverty rates, and minimum wage.

In the months following the first deluge of claims, many claimants received little or no communication from the Department of Labor for weeks or in some cases months. Even now, three years after devastating job losses began the rush for much needed support, many claimants still do not receive timely determinations regarding their claims. Current law provides a right to a hearing to an unemployment insurance benefit claimant only after receipt of a notice of determination. Where the claimant has neither begun to receive benefits nor received a notice of determination denying benefits, there is no means by which to request a hearing no matter how much time has elapsed since the initial date of application. By allowing individuals to request a hearing if they have not received benefits or notice that their claim has been denied within 30 days, this bill will provide claimants with some recourse. Further, providing a right to a hearing when thirty days have elapsed with no decision on benefit eligibility, brings the Department of Labor in line with the eligibility determination time frame for other state- administered benefits such as Family Assistance, Safety Net Assistance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and Medical Assistance benefits. All of these programs must make a determination and issue a notice of determination within 30 days of an application for benefits except in certain well-defined circumstances. Where applicants disagree with the determination, or where no determination has been timely issued, applicants have a right to a hearing.

A07485,A7485,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to wage claims for manual workers",Thiele,,This bill will clarify application of the labor law's wage theft provisions to wage claims for manual workers. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"This legislation addresses the unintended and unfair application of the state's wage theft law to instances where ""manual"" workers received full pay but were paid on a schedule other than weekly. The majority of employees in New York are paid biweekly. However, New York Labor Law § 191 requires that any ""manual worker"" be paid ""weekly and not later than seven calendar days after the end of the week in which the wages are earned,"" and while Labor Law § 190 defines ""manual worker"" - using outdated and undefined terms - to mean ""a mechanic, workingman or labor- er,"" there is no further statutory or regulatory definition to clarify the application of this unique weekly pay mandate. The Department of Labor's FAQ guidance document on pay mandates only says that it interprets ""manual worker"" to apply to any worker who spends more than 25% of working time engaged in ""physical labor,"" and that ""physical labor"" includes ""countless"" physical tasks performed by employees. Further, NYS DOL field auditors have provided employers with inconsistent determinations as to what occupations meet this statutory definition of ""manual worker."" As result of these vague terms and open-ended guidance, employers may be in violation of the Labor Law's weekly pay mandate for manual workers, even though such workers received full pay on a biweekly basis. Such actions would have constituted a simple Labor Law violation until 2019, when the First Department's decision in Vega v. CM & Assocs. Constr. Mgmt., LLC, 175 A.D.3d 1144 (1st Dep't 2019), misapplied the wage theft provisions of Labor Law § 198 and determined that manual workers who are paid in full every two weeks are entitled to seek, as liquidated damages, an extra payment equal to half of all wages they had already been paid for up to six full years. This outcome is exposing employers to significant - in some cases, multimillion dollar -- damage claims in cases where employers used the biweekly pay cycle, but also where employees received full payment of wages, as per their mutually agreed upon pay schedule with their employ- er. Since Vega was decided, more than 200 claims have been filed, often aimed at small, independent businesses. This legislation modifies Labor Law § 198 to limit its application to ""weekly pay"" violations to cases where an employer failed to make full payment of wages on the Labor Law's generally applicable semi-monthly pay frequency mandate, and the employer had previously been put on notice by the Labor Department through a forms order that they are subject to the weekly pay mandate.",This is a new bill.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,Immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A07485&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

This data includes quarterly wage data filed by employers in the state. While helpful, this data is often stale when an individual goes to apply for unemployment benefits. This creates opportunity in the system for improper payments and fraud to be perpe- trated. In November of 2022, the State Comptroller released an audit of the controls and management of the unemployment system, alleging $11B in fraud. This included estimates of a 10.34% improper payment rate and 4.51% fraud for SFY19-20, as well as a 28.89% improper payment rate and 17.79% fraud rate for SFY21-22. While the Department of Labor countered that their own fraud estimate was $4B - this still demonstrates that this is a significant problem that-needs to be addressed. New York busi- nesses are the ones paying the price - and need relief. Opportunities currently exist for the state to seek federal funds through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to pay for tools and services that address unemployment insurance fraud, improper payment and overpayment based on a recent report from the U.S. Department of Labor. However, time is of the essence, as requests for funding need to be made this July.

Dishonest contractors, in an effort to cut corners and save on labor costs, have engaged in a number of schemes to avoid paying workers the wage to which they are statutorily entitled. They include the kickback of wages, dual payrolls and cash-off-the books schemes. Under the existing law, a contractor may be debarred from participation in public work projects if the Bureau of Public Works finds that the contractor. has knowingly committed two violations of the prevailing wage law within a six-year period. Debar- ments are also imposed when a person or corporation, or any officer or shareholder who owns or controls at least ten percent of the outstanding stock of such corporation has been convicted of any of an enumerated list of felonies for conduct relating to obtaining, performing or attempting to perform a public work contract with the state, any munici- pal corporation, public benefit corporation or public body. Its federal counterpart, the Davis-Bacon Act, imposes a similar penalty on contrac- tors who are found to have disregarded their obligations to employees under federal wage-and-hour laws.

However, wages have been lagging behind the rising costs of living: in the third quarter of 2022, wages increased at only two- thirds the rate of inflation, according to CNBC. Unemployment benefits, which are based on workers' quarterly wages, are also lagging behind inflation, creating an effective cut to benefits every year.

Parent/guardian-teacher conferences usually happen once or twice a school year. Often IEP meetings are scheduled for early mornings or late afternoons to minimize the need for substitutes in the classroom. A child's parents/guardians know their child best, their, role is vital to the process, and they should pay a central role in creating a learning plan tailored to their child's specific needs.

The use of AI has expanded across many sectors and employers have begun to rely on AI tools to assist in the hiring proc- ess. Through the use of computer algorithms, these tools may score an applicant's resume, review personality and cognitive ability tests or analyze responses to sets of questions. Employers may then rely on the scores and feedback provided by the AI tool to determine if a person moves forward in the hiring process. Given the potential for privacy and security breaches, biased recommen- dations and other inaccuracies embedded in AI programs, experts are urging greater transparency and caution. According to a February 2022 survey by the Society of Human Resources Management, 79% of employers surveyed were relying upon AI tools in the hiring process. Despite the prevalence of these tools, a December 2022 Pew Research Center survey showed that 6 in 10 people are unaware of the use of Al in the hiring process and the majority of respondents would not apply for a position if they knew the employer relied upon AI tools to make hiring decisions.

Despite this requirement, however, a joint Senate-Assembly hearing on sexual harassment in the workplace held in February 2019, revealed that the DOI, has not taken steps to ensure that employers are actually complying with this requirement.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents and chil- dren alike had to adjust to remote learning and children being home instead of in school, sometimes unpredictably. Daycare centers were closed for the protection of children and staff. This created a new crisis for working parents to manage care for their children and their jobs - how can a parent be in two places at once? For millions of parents, disproportionately women, the answer was: they cannot. Accord- ing to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 2.4 million women left the workforce between February 2020 and February 2021. In comparison, 1.8 million men left the workforce during that year. This issue goes. beyond COVID, as school and day care closures occur in other types of disaster emergencies, like New Yorkers saw during Hurricane Sandy. This bill will take us a step in the right direction in ensuring parents can provide care for their children in an emergency without risking their livelihoods. For parents who can work from home, under this bill parents would be presumed entitled to do so when schools or daycare centers are closed during a disaster emergency. For parents who either cannot work from home or seek other types of flexibility such as a temporary schedule change in that situation, this bill would institute a right to request such flexible work arrangements without fear of retali- ation.

A07911,A7911,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to the unemployment insurance law, increasing the maximum benefit rate for unemployment insurance",Simon,,The bill intends to increase the maximum weekly unemployment benefit rate and restore fiscal health to the state's Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"New York State's unemployment rate reached 8.8% in January 2030 with more than 851,970 New Yorkers out of work. In the New York City metro- politan area, the rate is over 10%, and disproportionately higher for Hispanics at 23% and 38.7% for African-Americans. The State's long-term unemployment rate, which tracks those who are unemployed for 27 weeks or more, was 34% in 2009 exceeding the national average of 31.5%. The State's unemployment benefit rate, and taxable wage base have not been raised since 1998. Due to the large number of persons filing for unemployment benefits, the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund has become insolvent. The State has had to borrow from the federal government to pay benefits and will owe more than $3.5 billion by the end of the year. This deficit is expected to rise by an additional $1 billion during each of the next few years if nothing is done to address the problem. The limited amount of stimulus funds provided under the American Recov- ery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) does not resolve this long-term crisis to the Trust Fund. Both employers and the State will face signif- icant new costs if the Trust Fund is not restored to fiscal health continued insolvency of the Fund will result in higher federal unemploy- ment taxes for employers. When the Fund is solvent, employers may receive a federal credit reduction against the 6.2% federal tax they pay under the Federal Unemployment Trust Act (FUTA), which reduces their tax liability to .8%. When the Fund lacks sufficient contributions to repay borrowed money by the federal deadlines, the FUTA credit is reduced, which increases the net federal tax rate for employers. Without this legislation, the increased tax cost to New York employers is projected to reach $6.4 billion during the period of 2009-2018. The failure to increase the taxable wage base will also cost the State millions of dollars in interest on its federal loan. Under the bill, however, the State's interest on the loan would continually decline until 2016, when the Trust Fund's solvency would be restored. New York's taxable wage base of $8,500 is significantly lower than most other states, including New jersey ($29,700), Connecticut ($15,000) and Massa- chusetts ($14,000). The legislation would also increase the maximum weekly benefit rate of $405 which was enacted more than a decade ago. Since then, the spending power of $405 has declined by more than 21% to approximately $322. The current benefit rate is based on one-half of the state's average weekly wage in 1998. If this rate were adjusted to the current average weekly wage, the benefit would be closer to $575. The legislation proposes a more modest increase in the initial years following enactment in an effort to strike a balance between the need to increase benefits and raise employer contributions. New York's current benefit level places many unemployed workers and their families below the poverty threshold. The state's weekly benefit rate is much lower than that of nearby states including New Jersey ($600), Connecticut ($537), and Massachusetts ($628). In Oregon, which indexes unemployment benefits to keep pace with inflation, the benefit was increased to $493 two years ago. The need to raise unemployment benefits and the taxable wage base grows more urgent each year. Because benefits have not been increased, workers who have recently received extended unemployment benefits from the federal government have been deprived of additional income they and their families need at this difficult time. The failure to act also hurts local economies. Studies show that every dollar provided to work- ers returns approximately $1.64 through local purchases for rent, food and other basics, which in turn helps local businesses and generates tax revenues. The unemployment system was established to help New Yorkers support themselves after they lose their jobs through no fault of their own until they can find new work. This legislation will protect New York's unemployment system by ensuring the fiscal health of the Trust Fund, and in so doing, help avoid new costs for employers and the State if solven- cy of the Fund is not restored.",2021-22: A7150 Richardson - referred to labor 2019-20: A02158,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,to be determined,This act shall take effect immediately,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A07911&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

In 2008, in the United States, intimate partners committed approximately 552,000 violent crimes against women, including 35,690 rapes or sexual assaults, 38,820 robberies, 70,550 aggravated assaults, and 406,530 simple assaults. Notwithstanding the prevalence of domestic violence across demographic categories, it is overwhelmingly a crime perpetrated against women. Women are far more likely than men to be victims of domestic violence; the rate of intimate partner victimization per 1,000 persons is 4.3 for women compared with 0.8 for men. More broadly, African-American, Latina, and other minority women experi- ence a heightened risk of domestic abuse. The victimization of minority women is exacerbated by the institutionalized under-protection and discrimination by the police. Law enforcement's failure to adequately investigate and respond to reports of violence -- particularly domestic violence -- involving minority and immigrant women is often influenced by racial and ethnic stereotypes. In addition, such stereotyping often results in underreporting of violence and in disproportionate arrests of female victims rather than, or in addition to, their perpetrators. In addition, every year, according to Safe Horizons, more than 3 million children witness domestic violence in their homes. Children who live in homes where there is domestic violence also suffer abuse or neglect at high rates (30% to 60%). A 2005 Michigan study found that children exposed to domestic violence at home are more likely to have health problems, including becoming sick more often, having frequent headaches or stomach aches, and being more tired and lethargic. It has been found that victims of domestic violence lose an average of 137 hours of work a year. Some victims need time off from work to seek medical attention; others need time to seek restraining orders, or relo- cate to a safe place where an abuser cannot find for further victimize them. Other victims are prevented from getting to work when an abuser disables or takes the car, sabotages childcare arrangements, cancels service to or steals a cell phone, or leaves the victim without cash to use public transportation. These problems have led a number of states to pass domestic violence leave laws, which give victims of domestic violence the right to take time off for certain reasons. New Jersey signed its Domestic Violence Leave Act into law in October of 2013 Other states with similar laws include but are not limited to: California, Florida, Illinois, Washing- ton and Washington, D.C. While state laws providing employment rights for victims of domestic violence are not uniform, there is a clear trend toward awarding medical leave for victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse. It is time New York provided these victims with greater protections, similar to those done in its sister states.",New bill,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None,This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have become a law.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08000&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

The work permit program will allow this legal group of immigrants to work legally and under full protections of New York State laws. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"The federal immigration law has become outdated and impedes our nation's and New York State's ability to quickly and properly integrate asylum seekers allowed to enter the United States of America. Current federal law requires that an asylum seeker wait 150 days before applying for a work permit. Additionally, they are not eligible to receive an Employ- ment Authorization Document (EAD) until their asylum application has been pending for a total of 180 days. Unfortunately, existing work permit applications can take anywhere from 6 to 14 months to process, leaving asylum seekers without the legal paperwork required to obtain a job to support themselves and their families. In clear and undisputed legal terms, asylum seekers are legal immigrants under federal law and are desperate to provide shelter, food, and living expenses for them- selves and their families. Largely due to federal government policies that are antithetical to the well-being of both the asylum seekers and their welcoming communities, this group of immigrants is forced to work without proper documentation, leaving them open to exploitation from employers. The types of exploita- tion these immigrants will face without proper working papers range from working in dangerous conditions without training to having their wages stolen. Given the current federal inaction to expedite federal work permit applications for asylum seekers, it is incumbent on New York State to exercise its State's Constitutional duties and the powers reserved to States under the Federal Constitution and enact a New York State Asylum Seekers Worker Permit Program as outlined in this legis- lation. This bill will use the federal definition of Asylee to classify who is eligible for the NYS Worker Permit Program and include both asylees who have filed federal paperwork to obtain asylum status and,those in the process of filing such application. This bill will require the NYS Department of Labor to issue work permits for asylum seekers residing in New York within 45 days of application while granting the Commissioner of the NYS Department of Labor the authority to promulgate emergency rules and regulations to enact the provisions of this legislation. This legislation also amends the NYS Human Rights Law to include the right of asylum seekers to work in New York State while their federal immigration status is clarified and adds ""asylum seeker"" to the defi- nition of protected classes. In addition, the NYS Civil Service Law is amended to authorize state and local governments to accept applications for employment by those granted the emergency work permit. This proposed law will apply to both public- sector employment and private-sector employment.",New legislation,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,"There is a minimal fiscal impact due to the administrative costs of implementing a worker permit program.

As of September 2023, New York City is providing shelter to over 59,000 asylum seekers, at a cost projected to be $12 billion by June 2025. Under current law, asylum seekers cannot receive work authorization for at least 180 days after beginning an asylum application. The inability to work has forced asylum seekers to rely on New York City for shelter and necessities. Many work without authorization, leaving them suscepti- ble to exploitation. At the same time, there are 460,000 job openings in New York State, and over 120,000 fewer people in the labor force than pre-pandemic.

A08070,A8070,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to protections and rights afforded to delivery network company workers",Rosenthal L,,This legislation will provide protections for app-based food delivery workers against unwarranted account deactivation. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"Food delivery services have expanded greatly in recent years, allowing people to easily place food delivery orders on mobile apps and websites. The expansion of these apps has benefited restaurants, gig economy work- ers and customers; however, the ability for these workers to remain on the platform is dependent on the rating and feedback provided by custom- ers. While each platform has its own specific policies, generally, a delivery worker is at risk of having their account deactivated when their rating drops below a certain threshold, including for ratings and complaints levied against a worker for a slow or delayed delivery. In many cases, workers are provided no warning of a forthcoming deacti- vation or any opportunity to appeal. These practices by app companies have led to a highly competitive and speed-driven environment on the streets as delivery drivers compete to receive more orders and earn better tips. The 2022 Bicycle Crash Data Report released by the New York City Department of Transportation showed an increase in the number of injuries and deaths involving e-bikes and e-scooters, a mode of transportation relied upon by many delivery work- ers, over previous years. Requiring delivery apps to follow a standard process for account deactivation, including an opportunity for workers to appeal the decision, will remove some of the uncertainty in their job. This legislation would protect delivery drivers by requiring all food delivery services to adhere to a deactivation policy that prohibits account deactivation based on rejection or cancellation of an order, customer ratings or other factors without first conducting a fair and objective investigation, with exceptions for certain egregious miscon- duct. The legislation would also require all delivery drivers to receive advance notice of an impending deactivation and an opportunity to appeal the deactivation. Lastly, the legislation provides the state Department of Labor with the authority to enforce the law and provides workers with protections against retaliation for exercising rights afforded in the bill.",New bill.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None to the State.,180 days.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08070&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

However, for the remainder of the ""permanent"" workforce that will work at a location, there are no labor standards, and given low labor density of these industries prevailing wage is not an option. In these situations, Labor Peace Agreements are an effective tool to ensure protection and welfare of workers while securing the economic viability of a project, utilizing the state's ability to act as a market participant that is pursuing its own economic interests. In these agree- ments, contractors and subcontracts can forge agreements with a relevant labor organization that secures protections for workers in exchange for ensuring that workers refrain from disrupting a project for the duration of its construction. In requiring labor peace agreements, NYS can protect both workers and projects in which it has proprietary interest in by securing well-needed economic and safety protections for non-unionized workers, while ensur- ing that a project that the state has proprietary interest in is undis- rupted and able to meet its stated timelines.",Senate,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,"This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have become a law.

A08201,A8201,"An act to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to providing requirements for sick leave and the provision of certain employee bene- fits when such employee is subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of medically-necessary quarantine or isolation",O'Donnell,,"This legislation allows the Department of Health to declare, when neces- sary, the use of paid leave for medically-necessary quarantine or isolation, in order to allow New Yorkers to stay home and protect both their ,own health and the public health without fear of losing income or employment.","Over the past few years, New Yorkers have faced multiple public health crises and developed innovative solutions to address them. One signif- icant consequence of these challenging times was the impact of quaran- tine requirements on New Yorkers who must work outside the home. New York's Paid Leave for Mandatory and Precautionary Quarantine program allowed countless New Yorkers to stay home when exposed to COVID-19 and maintain both job protection and income, while protecting others from the spread of COVID-19. This model can and should be used to protect public health in future. Required quarantine length varies, but a quarantine leave program can be flexible. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the advised quarantine peri- od was five to fourteen days in the event of an exposure. When monkeypox was spreading throughout New York City in spring and summer of 2022, the quarantine period could be up to three or four weeks. However, when people rely on each and every paycheck, these lengthy absences from the workplace without guaranteed compensation could be the difference between putting food on the table and going hungry. When New Yorkers are forced to choose between a paycheck and their wellbeing, those with financial difficulties are placed in an impossible situation. While New York strove to curb the spread of disease by recommending isolation and limited contact post-exposure to dangerous illnesses, these issues have posed difficult decisions about health and income for many New Yorkers. This legislation will allow the Department of Health to implement a paid leave program when deemed necessary for health and safety. We must use what we have learned to avoid situations like that of Monkeypox or COVID-19 spread. At a time when New York's public health response has been tested, we must take advantage of recently developed frameworks to prevent disease spread and allow patients to stay quarantined until they make a full recovery.",New bill.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This act shall take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08201&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y
A08354,A8354,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to requiring employers to provide paid vacation time",Forrest,"Mamdani, Mitaynes, Shrestha",To guarantee paid vacation time to employees in New York State working an average of 20 hours or more per week. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"Guaranteeing paid vacation time in New York State would have several significant benefits. It would promote work-life balance, attract and retain talent, stimulate the economy, and contribute to overall societal well-being. By valuing the importance of rest, leisure, and personal growth, the state can create a healthier and more productive workforce while enhancing the quality of life for its residents. Firstly, it would promote a healthier work-life balance for employees. Taking regular time off from work allows individuals to recharge and rejuvenate, reducing stress and preventing burnout. By providing paid vacation time, the state recognizes the importance of rest and leisure in maintaining physical and mental well-being, ultimately leading to happier and more productive workers. Secondly, offering paid vacation time can help attract and retain talented employees. In a competitive job market, companies that provide this benefit are more likely to stand out and be desirable to job seek- ers. It demonstrates that the employer values the well-being of their workers and respects the need for time away from work. By offering paid vacation time as a standard benefit, New York State can create a more attractive business environment, encouraging companies to invest and grow within the state, which in turn drives economic development. Additionally, guaranteeing paid vacation time can have a positive impact on the economy. When individuals have the opportunity to take paid vacations, they are more likely to spend their time and money on leisure activities, travel, and local businesses. This increased consumer spend- ing stimulates the economy and supports various industries,, such as tourism, hospitality, and retail. In turn, local businesses benefit from the increased demand, leading to job creation and economic growth within the state. Lastly, paid vacation time contributes to overall societal well-being. It allows families and friends to spend quality time together, creating stronger connections and fostering a sense of community. Additionally, it provides individuals with the opportunity to pursus personal inter- ests, hobbies, and travel experiences, which can broaden horizons, enhance cultural understanding, and promote personal growth. By recog- nizing the importance of leisure and family time through guaranteed paid vacation, New York State can support the holistic well-being of its residents and contribute to a more balanced and fulfilling society.",None,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,TBD,Immediately,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08354&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"This bill would create a Joint Committee for Unemployment Insurance Oversight, which will examine the unemployment insurance system, specif- ically examining the equality in how funds are paid out, and any poten- tial need for alterations to the system. The Committee will publish a report on its findings and recommendations. Oversight and transparency are fundamental to the New York Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance program, primarily to ensure that funds are distributed accurately and efficiently to citizens entitled to those benefits. Unemployment insurance is a critical safety net for those who haVe lost their'jobs. It is essential that these funds are not misused or misallocated, so the individuals who genuinely need them receive appropriate support. Without proper oversight, there is an increased risk of fraud, waste, and abuse, leading to a depletion of resources that could otherwise support those in need. Transparency is vital in upholding public trust in the system. The unem- ployment insurance program is funded by taxpayers, and as such, they have a right to know how their contributions are being used. A transpar- ent system allows for public scrutiny, which can act as an additional layer of oversight. This can lead to increased accountability, and enhance the public's confidence in the system's effectiveness and fair- ness. Proper oversight and transparency can also help identify systemic issues or inefficiencies within the program. By consistently monitoring and reporting on the program's operations, potential problems can be identi- fied early and addressed promptly. This not only ensures the program's integrity but also its sustainability, preventing future imbalances or shortfalls. Oversight and transparency have the potential to promote equity within the program. Unemployment can disproportionately impact certain demo- graphics, and without a clear view of who's receiving support, it's difficult to ensure that funds are being distributed in a way that addresses these disparities. By ensuring transparency and oversight, through a new Joint Commission, the program can more effectively target support where it's needed, and work towards reducing inequities.",None,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,TBD,Immediately,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08436&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y
A08465,A8465,"An act to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to the maxi- mum amount of family leave time",Forrest,,To increase the amount of family leave time allowed to 26 weeks and to allow for 100% wage replacement. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"Increasing the amount of paid family leave time from 12 to 26 weeks and allowing for 100% wage replacement can have several important benefits including supporting the well-being and health of families, promoting gender equality, and bolstering employee retention and morale. Firstly, it supports the well-being and health of families by allowing parents to bond with their newborns or newly adopted children. This crucial time helps establish strong parent-child relationships and promotes the child's development. New York currently allows 12 weeks which is an insufficient amount of time to develop the crucial bond between parent and child. Moreover, paid family leave promotes gender equality by enabling both mothers and fathers to take time off work to care for their families. This helps reduce the burden of caregiving primarily falling on women and encourages shared responsibilities between parents. Additionally, paid family leave contributes to employee retention and morale. When employees can take time off without significant financial strain, they are more likely to return to work and remain committed to their jobs. This benefits both employees and employers by fostering a positive work-life balance and increasing productivity. Overall, imple- menting 26 weeks of paid family leave recognizes the importance of fami- ly well-being, gender equality, and employee satisfaction, offering numerous advantages for individuals, families, and society as a whole.",None,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,TBD,Immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08465&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

A08859,A8859,"An act to repeal section 581-d of the labor law, relating to the inter- est assessment surcharge",Thiele,,To abolish the interest assessment surcharge on employers intending to pay off state debt.,"In an effort to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, New York State mandated countless businesses to close or significantly reduce their operations. Many businesses remain closed-some for good-or at reduced operations. As a result, the unemployment rate and unemployment claims skyrocketed during the pandemic, many businesses closed and those still open struggle to stay afloat to keep what remaining employees they still have. With inflation costs rising, the aftereffects of the pandem- ic and impact of continuation of pandemic-related policies, like this unemployment assessment surcharge, businesses continue to be crushed. The already high cost of doing business and burdensome mandates that contributed to New York's inhospitable businesses climate, even prior to the pandemic, are now exacerbated in an economy that is struggling to recover. As New York's employers continue to try to recover, it is essential that New York moves to ensure businesses have the opportunity to thrive in this challenging business climate. This will require lowering the cost of doing business in the State, which can start with eliminating unnec- essary taxes, fees and assessments on New York's businesses such as the interest assessment surcharge. The interest assessment surcharge was established to cover the costs of interest due on advances from the federal unemployment account during periods where interest accrues. However, this costly fee burdens New York's employers and holds them responsible for the State's debt. It is simply unfair to think that, after all New Yorkers have already sacri- ficed to reduce the spread of COVID-19, our businesses can cover the interest on any loans the State takes to make these payments. The state has not made any effort to allocate funds in the state budget such as federal pandemic relief funds to pay off the outstanding UT debt so that this onerous interest assessment surcharge can be ended. Repealing the interest assessment surcharge would provide a boost for local businesses that need all the help they can get right now to stay open, and to help our local economies bounce back. This legislation would repeal this surcharge and be a positive step in the State's economic recovery from the devastating toll of the coronavirus pandemic.",This is a new bill.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,Immediate.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08859&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

Combined with the rapid development of new technology over the last decade, these factors have enabled the on-demand gig economy to flourish.

On-demand platform companies determine the rules that workers must follow, discipline workers for poor performance, specify how and when the work must be done, and control the exchange of payment between the worker and consumer, making these workers wholly dependent on the control and direction of their employer. However, these ""dependent workers"" are not afforded the same protections and benefits under the,law as traditional employees, making them vulner- able to various forms of exploitation, abuse, misclassification, harass- ment, and discrimination. While estimates of the size of the on-demand workforce vary due to a lack of a clear definition of what constitutes ""dependent worker"" under the law, it has become clear that these individuals continue to experi- ence low and unstable earnings, lack important worker protections and benefits, and often face dangerous health and safety hazards on the job. This legislation will help protect worker, business, and taxpayer inter- ests by awarding dependent workers crucial wage and collective bargain- ing protections now, while requiring the New York State Department of Labor to examine additional employment rights and benefits that may be extended to such workers in the future.",2020: A8343 (Crespo) - referred to Codes; enacting clause stricken 2021-2022: A2685 (Joyner) - referred to Labor 2023-2024: A917 (Joyner) - referred to Labor; enacting clause stricken,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,This act would take effect on the sixtieth day after it becomes a law.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08925&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, New York paid out approximately $70 billion in unemployment benefits in 2020 including roughly $115 million in overpayments, while other states across the country paid a combined $2.9 billion in overpayments. To address these concerns, the federal government has allowed states to waive repayments of benefits, including Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits, that are found to be without fault on.the part of the claimant and when such repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience. Under current New York State law, state unemployment benefits which are later determined to have been overpaid cannot be recovered from the claimant as long as the claimant received the benefits in good faith, did not make a false statement or representation, and did not willfully conceal any pertinent fact in connection with his or her claim. However, despite these requirements, data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that as of March 1, 2021, the State has not granted any waivers for overpayments throughout the duration of the pandemic and yet has continued to recover a total of $93.4 million in overpaid benefits during 2020. The enormous rise in unemployment claims during the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the ongoing issues with the New York State unem- ployment system and the overpayment of benefits. Amid the confusion of businesses closing, people losing their jobs, and navigating the outdated and complex UI system, it is reasonable to understand how some individuals might have made honest mistakes and unintentional errors on their unemployment applications, with no intent to defraud the system. And yet, as our economy moves forward to recover from the impacts of the pandemic, many of these claimants are now being asked to pay back debts and penalties that they never knew had incurred in the first place. To address these inequities, this bill would allow claimants that have been overpaid benefits to which they were not entitled during the COVID-19 pandemic to apply for a waiver to have these overpayments forgiven. Going forward, claimants would also not be held. liable for overpayments of state or federal unemployment benefits, as permitted under federal law, provided that the overpayment was not due to fraud or fault on the part of the claimant and the recovery of such overpayment would be against equity and good conscience.",2022: A6666 - Referred to Labor 2023-2024: A3647 - Referred to Labor; enacting clause stricken,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,"This act would take effect immediately and would be deemed to have been in full force and effect on and after March 9, 2020.",https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08928&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

These people have already spent their unemployment payments to pay rent, pay utility bills, and to purchase food for their families. These claimants are now being asked by the Department to return some of the benefits they received, with some New Yorkers owing more than $10,000. The Federal Government passed legislation in December of 2020 to provide every State with the authority to waive benefit overpayment amounts.

In the construction industry, it is not uncommon for workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement to work for multiple employers for short periods of time, and to be laid off briefly between jobs. Under existing law, if a construction worker is fortunate enough to work for 26 consecutive weeks and qualify for benefits, he or she would lose that eligibility once laid off even if the lay-off was for a short period of time. He or she would have to start over by working another 26 consecutive weeks to qualify for bene- fits. Because of the nature of the industry, this cycle would repeat itself over and over, making it extremely difficult for such employees to ever utilize paid family leave benefits under the existing law.

When these contracts systematically underfund services, they are relying on low-wage workers, predominantly of color, to fill in those gaps. Currently, the human services work force is overwhelmingly female (66%), with more than two-thirds of the full-time staff are workers of color (68%), and nearly half (46%) are women of color. They are highly educated and were lauded as heroes during COVID-19 but are paid only 70% of the salaries given to their government counterparts. This has resulted in human services workers being some of the lowest paid workers in New York's economy. The relatively low pay at the core human services sector resulted in nearly 25% of all human services workers qualifying for food stamps in recent years. The poverty-level wages appear to be built into how New York State currently contracts for human services and are a direct result of the decade of disinvestment that was included in the state budgets that were enacted beginning in 2008.

The law presently gives all New Yorkers who work for employers who employ 5 or more employees access to paid sick leave. Workers for employers of fewer than 5 employees receive only unpaid sick leave unless their employer had a net income of more than $1 million in the previous tax year. The paid sick leave law, coming as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a lifeline for millions of New Yorkers. The New York Paid Sick Leave law in its current form excludes most domestic workers who are not in New York City or Westchester County from paid sick time. The current wording of the state-wide paid sick leave statute does not cover domestic workers in private homes for paid sick leave purposes, only for unpaid sick leave due to the exclusion from paid sick leave for workers who work for employers with fewer than 5 employees and a net income of $1 million or less in the previous tax year. Both New York City and Westchester Country have passed coverage to explicitly include 40 hours of paid sick leave for domestic workers, which this proposal will reflect at the state level. There is an unfortunate history of excluding domestic workers from important labor law coverage. Much of that has been rectified but the exclusion of this workforce from the New York State Paid Sick Leave law is an artifact of the prejudice against including domestic workers as real employees. Coverage of domestic workers under our labor laws is a matter of basic equity and inclusion. Nationwide, over 90 percent of domestic workers are women, and a majority are immigrants, Black, and other women of color. According to the Fiscal Policy Institute, there are 328,000 domestic workers in New York. These workers perform essential work caring for children, elderly loved ones, and homes, and helping people with disa- bilities live independent lives.6 They are home care workers, nannies, and house cleaners, and they comprise a large and growing workforce. Throughout the coronavirus crisis, domestic workers have been placed under double pressure. Already underpaid, many have lost their jobs, or lost hours on the job, putting them under added financial stress. Even when on the job, however, domestic workers find themselves under added physical and psychological stress, acting as essential workers during a pandemic at some risk to their own health as they protect the health of others. These workers need and deserve paid sick leave. This important revision to the New York State Paid Sick Leave law will remedy the exclusion of domestic workers from the entitlement to paid sick leave throughout New York State in the same way these workers have been covered in New York City and Westchester.",20123-2024: A1129 - Referred to Labor; enacting clause stricken,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None to the State.,,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08933&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

To achieve cost savings, government has transferred most legally mandated human services for New Yorkers to nonprofits and in turn have created massive pay disparities within the field. Government is not just the predominant funder of human services in New York, it is also the main driver of human services salaries as it directly sets salary rates on contracts or does so indirectly by establishing costs for a unit or service, along with required staffing on a contract. Nonprofits contracted to provide human services are not only provided insufficient funding to pay their employees, but are met with chronic delays in payment, underfunding, and a lack of sincere collaboration to create meaningful and lasting interventions. Between 2008 and 2018, the State cut human services funding by 26 percent, with lower rates now than in 1980. These contracting practices have created extreme pay disparities where human services workers make on average 71% of what government employees make, and 82% of what private sector workers receive. The pay disparities in the human services sector also have important conse- quences for race and gender equity. The human services provider work- force of nearly 800,000 people is overwhelmingly female (66%), over two-thirds are full-time workers of color (68t), and nearly half (46t) are women of color. The majority (63%) have a 4-year college degree or better; yet they make about $20,000 a year less than a public sector worker with a comparable education. Government savings are being borne on the backs of low- income neighborhoods and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities who get reduced services and a workforce that is predominantly made up of women and people of color who are paid poverty-level wages. The relatively low pay in the core human services sector means that 15%- of all workers (both full- and part- time) qualified for food stamps in 2016-18.

The employees who perform this work provide a valuable service to the state and its subdivisions. Many are not well-compensated for that work and may live with great anxiety about their continued income. Those governmental entities that contract for such services periodically re-bid the work. The re-bidding is often required by law and, in any event, may be a sound fiscally prudent practice. However, the re-bidding can be extremely detrimental to the employees performing this work. Even though these employees may have become highly knowledgeable and efficient in their work, they may be entirely displaced if the successor contractor decides to use a different work- force. Call center employees live in dread of this kind of displacement. There is no reason why the state of New York and its subdivisions should themselves be the architect of this unnecessary misery for working people. This bill requires only that when political subdivisions of this state decide to procure new contracts for call center services, they require bidders to agree to retain the existing workforce for a period of 90 days during which the employees may demonstrate their fitness for the job. During the 90-day period, the employees may be dismissed only for cause. At the conclusion of that period, the employee must be provided a written evaluation and if the employee's service has been satisfactory, the employee must be offered continued employment. Similar laws providing for protection against this kind of displacement have been enacted in many jurisdictions. See, e.g., Calif. Grocers Ass'n v. City of Los Angeles, 54 Cal. 4th 177, 254 P.3d 1019 (Cal. 2011)(upholding a law that requires successor owner to retain grocery workers); Rhode Island Hospitality Ass 'n v. City of Providence, 667 F.3d 17(1st Cir. 2011) (upholding� law that requires successor owner to retain hospitality workers); Alcantara v. Allied Properties, LLC, 334 F. Supp.2d 336 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (upholding New York City Displaced Build- ing Service Workers Act, a law that requires successor employers to retain New York City building service workers); and Washington Service Contractors Coalition v. District of Columbia, 54 F.3d 811 (D.C. Cir. 1995)(upholding a law that requires successor contractors to retain building service workers). The bill also requires that a successor contractor site the work within a reasonable distance of the worksite that had previously been used for the work. In determining whether the site proffered by a bidder meets the reasonable accessibility standard, the governmental body contracting for the services must consider the availability of public transportation to retained call center employees and prevailing traffic patterns. A site which is within ten miles of, or average travel time by public or private transportation of not more than one-half hour from, the location of the affected employees' former work facility shall be presumed to be reasonably accessible unless unusual obstacles to access are present. This requirement of ""reasonably proximate"" siting is necessary to ensure that the offer of continued employment to the affected workers is a meaningful one. An offer of continued employment in some far distant place is of no practical help to the call center workers. The bill would provide remedies to call center employees displaced in violations of the provisions of the bill. Remedies would include the right to bring a legal action for reinstatement, lost wages, liquidated damages and attorneys' fees. This bill is a just and equitable accommo- dation of two important governmental interests: preserving the employ- ment of workers who provide a valuable service to the state and its subdivisions; and preserving periodic rebidding of government contracts to ensure that management of government services is done effectively.",2023-2024: A2052 - Referred to Labor; enacting clause stricken 2021-2022: A7305 - Referred to Labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,,This act would take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08939&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

The current mandatory overtime law allows a waiver .of enforcement during a declared emergency, and without a strict time limit on the duration of the mandatory overtime waiver, many nurses choose to leave the profession rather than deal with unlimited forced overtime. This legislation addresses the ongoing staffing crisis among nurses and improves enforcement of mandatory overtime. Currently the law allows for mandatory overtime during a natural disaster. This legislation would limit the law's suspension for a natural disaster or declared emergency and would prevent an employer from declaring a staffing emergency for routine nurse staffing needs. This legislation would also impose mone- tary penalties for employers who violate the law. The state continues to face issues related to nurse retention and by banning unfair mandatory overtime practices it will increase the number of nurses who want to work and benefit the patients that they serve.",2021-2022: A8874-B - Vetoed; Veto Memo 193 2023-2024: A2057 - Referred to Labor; enacting clause stricken,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,This act would take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08940&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

In practice, the Workers' Compensation Board is misinterpreting the intent of statute, permitting carriers to take credit by counting 130 calendar weeks from the date of injury, even if the claimant has not lost time from work for all, or any, of those first 130 weeks. Thus, a claimant who remained working and subsequently loses time from work, is unfairly penalized.

The Board's policy regarding claimant communication with providers extends well beyond the concern of improper influence set forth in WCL Section 13-a(6). The Board's policy prohibits claimants' counsel/representatives from having any verbal communication with treat- ing provider (or claimants' medical consultant),outside of the presence of the carrier/carrier's representative. It calls for the diminishment or complete preclusion of a claimant's medical opinion for any verbal communication by claimant's counsel/representative outside the presence of the carrier, no matter the nature of the communication. It requires every written communication by claimants' counsel/representative to a treating provider (or claim- ant's medical consultant) to be copied to the carrier, no matter the nature of the communication. It presumes that contact by a claimant's attorney or representative, that does not include the carrier or carri- er's representative, was done with the purpose of improperly influencing the treating provider or claimant's medical consultant. The Board's policy significantly hinders a claimant's ability to investigate the opinion of the treating physician or claimant's consultant, to properly determine the viability of a claim, and to prepare for litigation.

A08985,A8985,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to civil actions brought by employees",Bronson,"Tapia, Ardila, Jacobson",To allow for uniform and fair civil actions against employers under the Act. SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"The proposed amendment is modeled on the closely analogous anti-retalia- tion provision (outlawing retaliation for complaints of violation of most other Labor Law provisions) of Labor Law Section 215(2)(a). Public sector workers alleging violations of workplace safety, health, and violence prevention laws are being disadvantaged by a significant weak- nets in Labor Law Section 27-a(10) and 27-b(6)(e), the Act's anti-retal- iation provisions. Unlike nearly all other anti-retaliation provisions, these do not provide any private right of action. This Amendment will remedy that disparity. This Amendment will also remedy a significant statute of limitations problem. While Section 27a(10) states that on finding retaliation against a public employee who complained about a dangerous condition, the DOL ""shall request the attorney general to bring an action,"" Section 27-a(6) states that the employer may petition the IBA for review of the DOL decision - review that, in practice, often takes several years. Hartnett v. N.Y. City Transit Authority, 86 N.Y.2d 438, 443-444 (1995), after noting that the Act ""does not expressly provide victims of discrimination with a private right of action,"" held that the limita- tions period during which the Department of Labor (""DOL"") must request that the Office of the Attorney General (""OAG"") bring a PESH Act retali- ation suit in Supreme Court is three years. The OAG has often received requests from DOL to sue employers for violations of the PESH Act retal- iation statutes after the issuance of a decision by the Industrial Board of Appeals (""IBA""), which usually occurs very close to or after the expiration date of the limitations period. This has led to a suit being dismissed by the Supreme Court as untimely. Under current legislation, workers in this situation are left with no alternative method to pursue claims of retaliatory actions by employers, as they have no private right of action and can be deprived of any effective remedy through DOL or IBA delay. This results in an unfair process, requiring workers to await a protracted administrative process and then, possibly, see their cases dismissed as untimely. Furthermore, the current statute and its judicial interpretation forces DOL to request that OAG file actions against employers before the administra- tive process has been completed in order to avoid running afoul of the statute of limitations, causing the waste of judicial and administrative resources. These issues could be readily be avoided by amending the Act to provide a private right of action for workers, making it clear that a worker does not have to wait indefinitely while the DOL and the IBA consider their claims, but can sue the public employer directly. Being able to take action immediately is especially important in situations where workers are alleging that they have been fired in violation of the Act and are seeking a remedy of reemployment as soon as possible. The proposed amendments would bring the Act in line with most other anti-discrimination statutes, which expressly provide for a private right of action. Labor Law Section 215, which protects workers other than state and municipal employees against retaliation for complaints of illegality, permits workers to file suit within a two-year limitations period in addition to authorizing the DOL to provide relief. Wage payment statutes allow workers to sue employers directly (see, e.g., Labor Law Sections 198 and 663) in addition to authorizing them to file complaints with the DOL (Section 196-a); workers are specifically not required to await the outcome of an administrative complaint before suing, and the six-year limitations period is ""tolled from the date an employee files a complaint with the commissioner or the commissioner commences an investigation, whichever is earlier,"" until the DOL inves- tigation is completed (see. Section 198(2) and (3)). Amending the Act to clarify the statute of limitations and expressly grant a private right of action during that period would bring the Act in line with these statutes, allowing public sector workers to enjoy the same level of protection against retaliation as private sector workers.",2023-2024: A1254-A - Referred to Labor; enacting clause stricken 2022: 10553 - Referred to Labor,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None to the State.,This act would take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08985&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

Instead, the Board routinely makes findings of fact and law by the unilateral issu- ance of ""proposed conciliation decisions."" Such decisions are often issued absent the request of any party,- are not the result of a meeting or hearing, and are issued in English only, and using language that requires a high degree of both literacy and familiarity with the work- ers' compensation system. Moreover, the Board routinely delays or denies the applications_ of parties for hearings, frequently responding with administrative correspondence or proposed decisions that are an inade- quate substitute for a fair hearing on the issues. These administrative processes do not provide meaningful information to injured workers about their rights and benefits under the Workers' Compensation Law. This is especially true for workers with language or literacy barriers.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS :. Section one would provide scheduled increases to the weekly and maximum weekly short-term disability benefit rates as follows: On January 1, 2025, the weekly benefit rate would be 50% of an employee's average weekly wage not to exceed 50% of the state average weekly wage.

New York's DBL maximum benefit was last increased over thirty years ago in 1989 to $170 per week and has not been indexed to wage inflation. Surrounding states have continued to increase both the percentage of wages covered, and the maximum benefit, with New Jersey providing 85% cf wages covered with a maximum weekly benefit of $903, and Rhode Island providing 60% of wages covered with an $887 weekly maximum. This proposal would create parity between New Yorks Paid Family Leave and DBL laws by increasing the weekly benefit amount and percentage of wages covered by New York's statutory short-term disability benefits law to the same levels as provided by the Paid Family Leave program.

Wage theft costs our State millions of dollars a year in lost revenue and leaves law-abiding employers at a major competitive disadvantage. The New York State Department of Labor lacks the resources needed to effectively investigate and prosecute wage theft at scale and is heavily reliant upon uncertain federal funding. As a result, New York's workers may be increasingly vulnerable to exploitation. This legislation extends the reach of the state's public enforcement provisions in order to help ensure that exploitative employers do not get away with wage theft and other abuses; to help establish a level playing field on which law abiding employers can afford to compete; to protect the public interest; and to generate revenue to fund the New York State Department of Labor's own work. Extending the capacity and reach of New York's public enforcement strategies is critically impor- tant in this era for a number of reasons. The public and private enforcement mechanisms that have played a major role in wage theft and workers' rights enforcement for decades are being undeLmined in a number of ways, including: (a) unscrupulous employers who are using this moment of fear to intimidate and threaten workers into accepting exploitation; (b) a lack of sufficient funding for the Department has limited its capacity to enforce existing provisions of the Labor Law. In addition, private enforcement is often difficult to undertake in smaller workplaces and industries where workers' wage theft claims are small, and in rural communities where workers face challenges identify- ing counsel. The EMPIRE Worker Protection Act enables workers to ""step into the shoes"" of the government for the purposes of enforcing the New York Labor Law, and claims filed under the EMPIRE Worker Protection Act are public in nature and not subject to private agreements. The EMPIRE Work- er Protection Act builds upon recent advances in New York's labor protections, specifically the 2015 Achieve Pay Equity bill, which amended the law to strengthen the State's protections against pay discrimination for women. Additionally the EMPIRE Worker Protection Act is a proven model for strengthening labor law enforcement with Califor- nia having enacted similar legislation.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS,"State support for state staffing has diminished over time. The NYS Department of Labor is down approximately 897 staff from 2013 or roughly 21%. As the state has moved to reduce its staff, important new laws have been enacted to protect workers against intimidation in the workplace, to enhance workplace health and safety, to protect workers against wage theft and violence and protections against discrimination and retali- ation. It has become abundantly clear that the Department of Labor does not have appropriate number of staff to investigate many serious accusation against employers for potential labor law violations. This inability to enforce the state's labor laws leaves workers vulnerable and calls into question the state's commitment to enforcing its own labor laws. This legislation seeks to remedy this situation by providing a dedi- cated, recurring revenue stream strictly for enforcement purposes utilizing the resources the agency recovers from penalties imposed on employers found in violation of the state's labor laws. This legislation establishes the ""NYS Worker Protection and Labor Law Enforcement Fund"" which will provide dedicated funding to the Department to support its investigatory staffing and labor law enforcement needs. Additionally, in order to ensure complete transparency, this legislation also requires the Department to submit a report detailing its expenses from this fund, the number of staff funded with these resources, the number of enforcement proceedings initiated and the amount collected from substantiated violations, if any.",New bill,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,Uses resources secured through penalties imposed on employers from substantiated violations to establish a dedicated fund to support labor law enforcement.,"Effective April 1, 2024.",https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A09281&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

A09355,A9355,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to employers' obligations to report wages for the purposes of unemployment benefits, the payment of unemployment benefits, and employer penalties for non-compliance",Bronson,,The purpose of this bill is to ensure that all employers that have been ruled covered by New York's unemployment insurance laws report their employees' wages and contribute to the UI Trust Fund.,"Many NY employers have refused to pay the ordinary Unemployment Insur- ance (UI) taxes that all other NY employers must pay. They have also been failing to report their employees' wages to the NYS Department of Labor (DOL), which slows down the delivery of crucial Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits by months. This is all despite the fact that state courts and agencies have repeatedly ruled, for years, that many of these corporations are covered by NY's UI law and their workers are entitled to receive benefits. These employers' failure to pay into the UI Trust Fund has added millions to the UI Trust Fund debt. The large UI Trust Fund debt, currently 6:8 billion dollars, has triggered higher UI tax rates for the rest of NY employers and has hurt workers by forcing NY's maximum weekly benefit rate, the lowest in the Northeast Region, to remain frozen at $504 per week since 2019. Not only is the failure of employers to report wages bad for workers, it also creates an unequal playing field with employers who do the right thing and pay into the Trust Fund while others skirt the system, gaining an unfair advantage by paying nothing. The majority of these employers fail to make contributions because they misclassify their workers as independent contractors instead of employ- ees. When employers fail to report a worker's wages to New York State, the worker is unable to collect UI if they lose their job because the DOL does not have a record of earnings upon which to determine monetary eligibility. The burden is then put on the unemployed worker to prove not only the amount of their earnings but also that they are an employee and not an independent contractor. Misclassified workers are forced to request a reconsideration to the DOL, answer numerous questionnaires and provide extensive documentation of wages - a process that takes at least 3 months and often more than 6 months to complete. Most misclassified workers either don't apply for UI because they don't know they are eligible or give up after they have applied because of the excessive bureaucracy. New York UI law requires employers to make contributions to the UI Trust Fund based on the amount of wages that they pay their employees. The DOL uses audits of employers to determine if their workers are employees under the NY UI law and then assesses contributions and penalties. Audits are backward-looking, which means they determine liability for failure to contribute in the past, but do not then require the employers to report their current workers' wages. The current audit process is ineffective because the DOL does not require companies that have been determined to be employers to start reporting wages and making contrib- utions for its similarly situated employees going forward. In addition, penalties for failing to report wages and make contributions are extremely low, which provides little incentive for employers to follow the law. This bill addresses the inadequaties of the current enforcement mechanisms by requiring employers to report their workers' earnings and contribute to the UI Trust Fund. It creates a presumption that DOL determinations finding individual workers to be employees apply to all of the employer's workers who provide similar services and makes clear that employers must report all of their employees' earnings and make contributions on those earnings. The bill also substantially increases penalties for failure to report earnings and make contributions and creates a new tool beyond audits to deal with non-complying employers by requiring the DOL to apply to the state Supreme Court for an order requiring the non-complying employer to report their employees' wages. In addition, the bill provides a private right of action to allow work- ers to require employers to report their employees' wages. Finally, the bill makes it easier and faster to establish UI monetary eligibility for workers of employers who fail to report their wages.",New Bill,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,None.,This act shall take effect immediately.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A09355&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

A09800,A9800,"An act to amend the labor law, in relation to liquidated damages for labor law violations",Bronson,"Ardila, Simon","To align the rights of plaintiffs in state court with those in federal court, where class action plaintiffs can claim liquidated and statutory damages for certain wage violations.","The Legislature has recently made efforts to enhance the Labor Law's protections against wage theft. However, a lesser-known section of the Civil Practice Law and Rules has been a barrier for many workers seeking to recover unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and statutory damages under the Labor Law on a class-wide basis. The Labor Law Enforcement Parity Act (LLEPA) aims to align the rights of plaintiffs in state court with those in federal court, where class action plaintiffs can claim liqui- dated and statutory damages. Several New York state courts have ruled that class action plaintiffs enforcing the Labor Law in state courts are not entitled to liquidated damages (which are awarded in individual actions as amounts equal to unpaid wages) due to a restriction in CPLR § 901(b) against recovering ""penalties"" in class actions. See, e.g., Divlijanovic v. Saks & Co., 2018 N.Y. Slip Op. 30236, at *12-13 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2018). This stance persists despite recognition by numer- ous federal and state courts that recent amendments to the Labor Law made liquidated damages compensatory rather than penal. For instance, Rana v. Islam, 887 F.3d 118, 123 (2d Cir. 2018), and Vega v. CM & Assocs. Constr. Mgmt., LLC, 175 A.D.3d 1144, 1146 (1st Dep't 2019) acknowledged the amendments aimed to align with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), emphasizing compensation over deterrence. However, some courts, like in Divlijanovic and Griffin v. Gregorys Coffee Mgmt. LLC, 2019 N.Y. Slip Op. 31125 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2019), have overlooked the legislative intent to categorize liquidated damages under the Labor Law as compensatory. Moreover, class-wide claims for statutory damages under the Wage Theft Prevention Act have been disallowed by New York State courts based on their interpretation of CPLR § 901(b), which limits class-wide claims involving statutory minimum recoveries. This interpre- tation forces workers pursuing class actions in state court to forgo their right to liquidated damages, effectively losing up to 50% of the damages they are owed. Additionally, it prevents them from making any class-wide claims for violations of the Wage Theft Prevention Act. Conversely, in federal court, such actions allow for the recovery of these damages on a class-wide basis, as seen in Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 413 (2010) and Vargas v. Howard, 324 F.R.D. 319 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). The frequent inability to pursue Labor Law claims in federal court (because there is no basis for federal jurisdiction, such as a federal claim or diversity of citizenship) leaves workers without an effective means to recover liquidated damages for wage theft violations and statu- tory damages for Wage Theft Prevention Act violations. This is partic- ularly harmful to low-wage workers and workers with smaller claims, for whom individual suits are unfeasible and class actions are critical in allowing them to vindicate their rights. LLEPA's amendment to Sections 198 and 663 of the Labor Law will give state court plaintiffs seeking class-wide relief the same rights as those in federal court to seek liquidated and statutory damages, thus ensuring that the Labor Law is enforced equally in state and federal courts.",,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,"TBD,",This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all actions concerning labor law violations that occurred within the six years prior to this act's effective date.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A09800&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y

This suggests that the number of work-related death claims was significantly underreported and that the number of claims for death benefits actually filed by surviving family members of essential workers bears no relationship to the number of eligible families. These families are presently ineligible for death benefits due to the requirement that such a claim be brought within two years of death. This disparity can be caused by several factors including, but not limited to unfamiliarity with the eligibility for death benefits or whom to contact to seek those benefits; the failure of employers to properly advise surviving families of their ability to file for such benefits; language barriers and the overwhelming grief of sudden loss of a provid- er in the midst of a global pandemic. This bill provides families with one additional year from the date signed into law to file a claim for death benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled.",New bill.,There are no votes for this bill in this legislative session.,To be determined.,This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be deemed repealed two years after such date.,https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A09804&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y
